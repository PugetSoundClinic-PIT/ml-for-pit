cdp-seattle-21723dcf,80858d2f932a,We're having the public hearing this afternoon and then plan to vote on the requested alley vacation at our full council meeting next week approval of the alley vacation would facilitate the development of this mixed use mixed income project to be built near frequent fixed transit transit of our growing uh which includes our growing light rail system nearly half of the 771 new residential units would be affordable to low-income families under 60 of the area median income i look forward to the comments during today's public hearing thank you thank you council member peterson as presiding officer i'm now opening the public hearing on clerk file three one four four five nine relating to a petition of grand street commons llc for an alley vacation of block 14 joe joe's c kinnears addition to the city of seattle beginning of the block bounded by south grand street uh 22nd avenue south south whole gate and 23rd avenue south the online registration to speak opened at 12 noon today and i will call on speakers in the order in which they registered the online registration will remain open until the conclusion of this public hearing the same rules applied to the public comment period will be applied to this public hearing each speaker will be provided two minutes to speak and each speaker will hear a chime when they have 10 seconds left of the allotted time speakers microphones will be muted at the end of the allotted public comment time public comment relating to clerk file to the clerk file is only being accepted at this public hearing speakers are asked to begin their public comments by stating their name please remember to press star six not pound six star six after you you hear the prompt if you have been unmuted bringing up the list here we have randall olson allison van gorp susan davis melissa weschler maria barrientos and david tan randall good afternoon welcome thank thank you for the opportunity to comment today my name is randall olson i'm a land use attorney at cairn cross and implement in seattle i represent mount baker housing regarding this project this is an exciting day i have been working with mount baker housing on the valley vacation for over two years and it has been a very long journey but the city should be proud of what it is helping to achieve here including the 206 units of affordable housing at 60 percent ami just in the mount baker housing portion of this project there'll be over 350 units of affordable housing across the entire project and my comment today is to voice support for approval of the alley vacation and i also ask that you support and approve council may council member mosquitos proposed amendment which would waive the requirement for mount baker housing to pay the city for the vacated alley as the council knows from from tackling this issue of affordable housing for many years affordable housing projects face many of the same permitting and construction cost issues that market rates and housing does lumber steel concrete it takes to build affordable housing is the same it takes for market rate housing and the costs are the same same with the permitting process so those costs limit how much affordable housing can be built and funded here the city's office of housing is funding the construction of mount baker housing affordable housing building and council member mosquitos amendment would waive the requirement for mount baker housing to pay for the vacated alley land which the effect of of that would be to keep affordable housing dollars with the office of housing where they could be deployed to construct more affordable housing in the city so the the issue of developing affordable housing is not one of a lack of desire but rather a lack of funding and council member mosquitos amendment is an easy way to allocate more dollars towards affordable housing so please approve the alley vacation and the proposed amendment thank you very much thank you randall,other
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,80858d2f932a,Thank you councilmember mosqueda any other items for good of good of the order and other business i will make the request here to be excused from the november 29th council briefing and full council meeting are there any objections hearing no objections thank you colleagues if there's no other if there are no other items for the good of the order colleagues this does conclude,other
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,80858d2f932a,Um you know living where i live i've had the opportunity to see mount baker housing in action um especially as they've expanded and the construction that's underway currently along mlk and mcclellan um the recent and ongoing construction has been well done and it appears to be well managed um we're in a housing crisis right now and building more affordable housing near amenities like we have in our neighborhood light rail parks access to jobs and shopping it's essential and i'm looking forward to sharing these facilities in my neighborhood with more neighbors um i'm urging you today to do whatever you can to encourage this type of affordable housing development near opportunities near transit near parks um please approve the alley vacation and council member mosquitos amendment to waive the fee for for the vacation um i wholeheartedly support mount baker housing grand street commons project and your approval on this uh next week will help the project to move forward more quickly and with a larger number of affordable units,other
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,80858d2f932a,Please remember to press star six not pound six star six to hear the after you hear the prompt if you've been unmuted mr howard gale uh first up i hear you're already with us and i'm going to call on the first number of people so you know which list you're you're in so we have howard gale david haynes randall olson allison van gorp susan davis melissa weschler,other
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,80858d2f932a,Second we'd also like to voice our strong support for council member mosquitos amendment to waive the alley vacation fee on this project and other similar projects in the future given that mount baker is relying on funding from the office of housing to execute this project it's logical to cut out the circular references and reduce costs up front to allow these projects to remain competitive for public funding for this project in particular where the alley has never been in use and its elimination will have no negative impact on circulation or services for the rest of the neighborhood waiving fees for the property in exchange for affordable housing is a no-brainer finally even before the vacation has been granted this project has required significant time and investment in the community already spanning from an extensive public outreach effort during a pandemic nonetheless to a long string of meetings with s dot and the design commission during the alley vacation process which has taken over two years to bring the project before you today projects that require street and alley vacations take exponentially more time thank you melissa and my apologies if the ding interrupted your comments please do feel free to send in any other comments you'd like reflected on the record to us up next is maria barrientos followed by david tan and patricia gray still not listed as present so if you'd like to call in please call into the confer the number provided in the confirmation email good afternoon maria welcome maria i see you're on mute so if you press star six not pound six there you are welcome good afternoon this is maria barrientos um i wanted to say that i volunteered to assist mount baker housing on this alley vacation process about six months ago i did want to say obviously i support the alley vacation it does make the entire three block project way work way better creating this great public plaza for the community use and providing the opportunity to build more affordable housing um is a really good thing so i i urge you all to vote yes for the alley vacation i also support council member mosqueda's amendment to waive the alley vacation fee it's a very easy way for the city to ensure scarce affordable housing dollars are spent to create housing i will also add i was stunned at the cost of length of the vacation process and as melissa mentioned the fact that all the funds are coming from office of housing is uh it's sort of sad to spend that much money to get through this process but hopefully we're almost there and appreciate the opportunity to talk thank you thank you maria up next is david tan followed by patricia gray patricia you are not listed as present so please do call in if you'd like to provide comments david welcome and good afternoon thank you very much and thank you for the opportunity to speak my name is david tan i'm the executive director of mount baker housing association we are the proponent of part of the proponent of the petition for the vacation of the alley at grand street comments project in block 14 i rather than reiterate what everybody else has said in front of me which is all very true i wanted to to point a little bit to maria's comments just before me about the extensive cost and time related to the alley vacation on this project which i believe would be true for other projects and i and i and i say this in support of council member muscated amendment to the petition um if i understand the numbers in our own budget correctly we have spent well over a half a million dollars in pursuing this allocation and uh it is somewhat inefficient in my view uh to uh to do you know to have that uh sort of hanging over our heads as a non-profit affordable housing developer who is the fortunate recipient of city funding for our projects so i urge you to um vote yes on the alley vacation and also speak strongly in support of our council member muscated amendment thank you very much thank you david uh patricia gray it can you confirm that she is not present there are no further public hearing registrants thank you that was our last speaker remotely
