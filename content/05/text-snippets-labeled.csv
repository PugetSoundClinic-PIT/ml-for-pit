Any other comments on the bill in front of committee? Seeing no additional comments. Will the clerk please call the roll?,admin
So any changes the council may approve throughout the year to the adopted budget. Would in any payments made based on those changes would be consistent and then makes explicit reference to current state law. So that's the template for the city's budget.,budget
"Have all the information we need as we look at the budgets in front of us. Okay. Hey, any additional comments or questions?",budget
"And then be stabilized and operational. In, you know, Q3, Q3, hopefully not Q4, 2023. And with that, I'll hand it back over to Chris.",budget
"I just. Hop in there for a quick second to add additional context. And I, I might reframe it to say that I think from my perspective, the stall is really in large part due to the company is not coming to the table in good faith. And offering only a nickel increase in the last negotiation.",budget
"This is the additional cost caused by the impact. And our projections have showed that going up at about $870,000. A month.",budget
"I think that we're going to see that increase and we're going to see the level of distrust with government agencies decrease. Not really sure if that's what you were looking for, Mark. Thank you.",budget
"The 2022 adopted budget includes $9.3 million. Christopher, I think we're one slide off. Jacob, would you mind moving it forward one more?",budget
Yep. About 30 a month right now. Wow.,budget
"Given that this legislation is coming up after budget decisions for 2022 have already been made, there needs to be some continuing discussion about whether there are funds available to reprioritize for this purpose, assuming that a contract would be executed in 2022. It's not clear that either of the departments have funding that they would be able to reprioritize for this. I don't believe that there is existing extra funding, especially given the current conversations about general fund challenges moving into 2023.",budget
"It may be worth further conversations both with the department and committee about the scope of enforcement on this piece of legislation might look like. The last piece of the funding conversation is that even if a funding were found to support the contract enforcement in 2022, there will need to be conversations during the budget discussions for 2023 that would provide ongoing funds for a contract with a research university. It's both a conversation about how to implement this legislation in 22 and then assuming that that is not ongoing funding what that looks like in 2023 and beyond.",budget
Input from. As the city workforce and the workforce rallying points are an example of this that I'll discuss more in the next slide. One lesson that we've learned as we implement this new policy is the need to be able to use one-time funding.,budget
"And as Terry mentioned, we've been able to use one-time funding such as urban security initiative funding. But as Tay will discuss more. This funding is, is unreliable.",budget
"That the tested in 2016. And then it was consistent around 60 and 68 and 57. So over the years, it's been a little bit more consistent.",budget
"Okay. So you're saying, so you're making a direct correlation, but was, you know, the. The executive order wasn't in place for very long, but it wasn't in place for a very long time.",budget
"And, um, that is the only information I had for you today, um, because there are no, uh, amendments that would seek to prohibit or condition, um, the spending in any way that would potentially, uh, disrupt the grant. Um, there's, there's not a need to discuss any fiscal matters, um, uh, relative to provisos. So, um, at that point, I think, uh, um, we are, the committee is, is ready to vote.",budget
"These costs include outreach, development of the technology to support the registry and temporary staff to support these efforts. The department anticipates requesting this additional general fund support in the forthcoming mid-year supplemental budget. SDCI will then consider what if any ongoing staffing and funding needs might be necessary next year and these would be included in the 2023 proposed budget.",budget
I'm wondering if we might just have you elaborate on that for just a quick second given the budget situation that we're all in and in together as a city family. We are looking forward to opportunities to mindfully move forward important legislation like this as well as couple these discussions on policy with the fiscal impact since we don't have a traditional system as council member Strauss I know it's something you were advocating for last year to have a policy committee then a fiscal committee and then full council. So would love to take a second if you might for central staff to help us identify any additional considerations around the fiscal note and if there's a possible funding source again I'll underscore my support for this legislation.,budget
"The budget has been a topic of the past. This time, I'm not having any presentations. I'm just going to be answering your questions so submit your questions on my website and I'll answer them.",budget
"There is a published agenda, excuse me, there is a published calendar on their website, and the published agenda will be up there at the latest on Thursday midday. Colleagues, this is an opportunity for us to hear in real time the report out from the Economic and Revenue Forecast Department as they present to the Council on the various strategies and recommended actions, and it will be the opportunity for the Council to take its first action, either accepting or amending the proposal in front of us. We will then have a follow-up in our committee on April 20th to have a presentation, a report out on any actions that the Council takes, so you'll have two opportunities to really hear in depth the presentation on the revenue forecast.",budget
I think that is a really good way to. Ensure that policy is able to leverage funds and vice versa. Just wanted to throw that out there.,budget
"Transmitted to the mayor, probably in June, early June. In the hopes of being able to have meaningful input on the proposed budget recommendations. So the full council will also receive a copy of those initial budget recommendations.",budget
"Yeah, sorry. One more last question for Javier. I might've missed it in your presentation, but how is core paid for?",budget
"It's 37%. Also want to flag that. The, the, the FAS has has recognized some improvements in the licensing fee.",budget
That that would result in greater equity. In in last year's. Pre budget process had actually made a proposal.,budget
"So anything that increase tax on a small business, propose a harm that in some cases, you know, in some of these business, the revenue projection is very marginal anyway. So that's my answer as a small business owner to your question. Thank you, Olly.",budget
"In past years, when the watch list has come before us. I have advocated. And for many years, it sounded like the budget office was amenable to doing this, but it hadn't happened.",budget
"The overhead equipment replacement project. The overhead equipment replacement project. So they, that is a new format, but, but it's consistent with 2021.",budget
"And I'm just wondering, I know that the CBO was talking about the difficulty of doing. Sort of a programmatic. Inclusion on the watch list is.",budget
"You know, the, the program will spend over time. So I think that's one of the main challenges is, is reporting the financial data. So there is.",budget
"And we'll have a chance to ask any questions or hear the outcome of the council's deliberation. At our April 20th meeting, we will have the office of economic revenue forecast presentation on what the council deliberated. We'll have the CBO city budget office forecast presentation, which will comment on the other revenue streams.",budget
"Thank you. So we'll have a chance to ask questions or comment on the other revenue streams and revenue forecasts of that. Do not go through the office of economic revenue forecast, and we'll have an explanation of which ones do and which ones don't go through each of those offices.",budget
"Oh, that's $10,000. Total or. Yeah.",budget
A terribly significant in the scheme of our budget. Okay. Great.,budget
"Uh, Let's see, it is, it would be, uh, lost potential revenue. To the city as opposed to an actual expense. Um, Okay.",budget
"And what happens there in the longterm should also be considered as you're considering this, um, The options within this. Thank you. Thank you.",budget
"And so when thinking of a transfer like this, Um, You know, There may be future situations where, um, this could happen again. And so just wanting to make sure that, that all your. You know, teas are crossed and eyes are dotted.",budget
"Next. As Robert mentioned, uh, 2021 was a challenging year for all of us. Um, and we had some challenges and lessons learned.",budget
We are a very small office with currently 10 staff members and with an annual budget of $5.7 million and some of those dollars come from the general fund and others come from grants. Next slide please. Great.,budget
We've actually collected bank notes off of eBay and Craigslist and stuff that actually say University National Bank. So it's history of printing U.S. currency. It just blows my mind.,budget
"All right, Elsa. Thanks, Quinn. So this year was a historic investment in the capital budget, following on a previous historic year in 2021.",budget
"This the package will raise approximately just shy of 17 billion dollars over the next 16 years. The revenue sources and funding allocations haven't changed significantly since the briefing that we did earlier on in the legislative session, except for the export fuel tax proposal was dropped late in legislative session and replaced by two transfers from the general fund and the public works trust fund. I the the overview document that's provided provides a broad summary of both the revenues and spending.",budget
We'll also have the office of economic revenue forecast. Presentation and a presentation from the city budget's office for cap presentation. These two items will provide a more complete picture to the revenue forecast for the remainder of this year.,budget
"And for looking at 2023 and 2024. I'll provide a quick summary of the economic revenue forecast council for which council president, whereas, and myself sit on. Along with two representatives from the mayor's office, which just met on Friday.",budget
"This revenue forecast council is the opportunity for us as a council along with the executive and members of the public to get in real time joint updates on what the revenue forecast looks like, Instead of having that information just be digest within the city's budget office. This is a opportunity for us to use a revenue forecast council process, similar to King County, similar to the state that has the leap program and independent revenue forecast office as well. And we had a great conversation on Friday last week and accepted the revenue forecast that the office of economic revenue forecast office presented to the council.",budget
The good news is that the overall forecast. Increased our overall revenue forecast has increased to the tune of 32.5 million. Available in new general fund dollars for the year 2022.,budget
"And there's also been an increase of 57.3 million dollars in non-general fund. Of course, that includes things like REIT and jumpstart. The non-general fund dollars, as we know, is dollars that are specifically allocated for specific purposes.",budget
So I'm distinguishing between the 32.5 million for general fund. Which is the $1.5 million for general fund. And the $1.5 million for non-general fund.,budget
And the $1.5 million for general fund. And the $1.5 million for non-general fund. So I'm distinguishing between the 32.5 million for general fund.,budget
Which is also great news. And in addition to that 57.3 million for non-general fund. I also want to note that this picture is not yet complete because there's a number of revenue sources that still remain within the city's budget office and the CBO will be coming to our committee meeting next week.,budget
"As I noted to provide an overall forecast for the rest of the revenue streams. I'll also note and lift up a part of the forecast news, which is much of the forecasting is still volatile given the international uncertainty and increased expenses. That includes the ongoing wars, plural across the globe, and also.",budget
"In the revenue forecast this year allowed for us to see that there is a projected increase of close to $44 million for the, over the November projections for 2022 jumpstart revenue, bringing the total for jumpstart revenue. To $277 million. As folks were reporting out on jumpstart revenue and saying, you know, there's a lot to be figured out in terms of how the return to work.",budget
"As was noted in the presentation, even the pessimistic forecast for jumpstart revenue, Makes me very optimistic. So I wanted to repeat that because it is at this point, $277 million just for 2022 alone. We're going to have some more updates for April 20th at our meeting to look at the fuller revenue picture again.",budget
"Every year, the department does request budget authority for these revenue back expenditures. And we usually wait to the end of the year so we can have a more accurate reflection of how much has actually been used by our detectives. Um, and then trying to see what it, what we asked for, for reimbursement.",budget
"And I want to try to be respectful of that. All I know is that they have decided to sell. Yeah, sorry.",budget
"No deeper insights. Well, because asking why is maybe the first step of saving it and reversing that decision, but all but out. OK, thanks.",budget
We will have that for briefing discussion and possible vote. We will have the April revenue forecast update. This will be presented as a summary of the forecast Council meeting for which Council President Juarez and I currently sit on and had our meeting last Friday.,budget
"We will then have a rounding out of the revenue forecast presented by the city's budget office. This will provide an update on the other lines of revenue that the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council does not have under its purview but remain at the city budget's office. With the combination of the information that the Revenue Forecast Council received last Friday and the update from the city's budget office on other lines of revenue, we will have a fuller picture of the revenue forecast for the remainder of 2022.",budget
So I wanted to really emphasize the origin of those dollars. Thanks so much. Thank you.,budget
"Them Councilmember, this is very straightforward. And this was considered in last year's budget. And we can identify that these were coming.",budget
"As Calvin mentioned, this is a . straightforward ordinance. This would allow us to accept grant revenue X at in excess of $25 million. For the East, marginal wave.",budget
"So we can see what voters were expecting. Nevertheless, it is very useful when we start taking about this. Let us jump into this presentation.",budget
I'm assuming that would change over time. That's updated. I'm assuming that would change over time.,budget
"Just to set the stage here for a quick second. As you'll recall on Friday, April 8th, We had the opportunity to look at the out years as well. And factor in how that revenue forecast may, may affect our ability to carry out.",budget
"Desired implementation for items this year, and also to help us plan for the 2023, 2024 budget cycle. By way of reminder, the office of economic and revenue forecast was championed by our former colleague. And to create greater accountability around our finance decisions.",budget
"There are caveats though. And I know director noble will walk us through some of those caveats here in just a moment, like increased costs, inflation instability and projects. And of course the ongoing budget deficit that we are working hard to address.",budget
"I should say the budget gap that we're working to address because there's ongoing needs and some short-term revenue that has been used over the years. I'm delighted to have the team here with us from the office of revenue and economic forecast. And that director noble, we'll be able to walk us through this along with yonder us and along with our central staff's office.",budget
"And for the work that you've done with us on the revenue forecast council to get us through that first revenue forecast projection on April 8th, we'll then have a presentation in our next item on the city budget office and from the city budget office. And then you'll have a chance to hear from the city budgets director, Julie Dingley on the revenues that they forecast again, as a reminder, not all revenue lines go through the revenue forecast office. So it's important for us to have the independent office of economic revenue forecast present their information.",budget
"We will then have that followed by the city budgets office and the fuller picture we'll be able to see at the end of those two presentations. And thanks to central staff for the work that they're doing to pull it all together, to tell us what this means, not just for the rest of 2022 and not even just for 2023, 24, but they will be providing us with an overall look over the next six years when we reconvene at our May 4th meeting. So without further ado, let me turn it directly over to director Ben Noble for our new independent office of economic and revenue forecast.",budget
"So this outline actually is useful to talk about in part, because it describes the forecast process as well. So our forecasting process is really a two-step one. We first developed an economic forecast for the region in particular, looking to project fundamental variables, which is what we call the economic forecast.",budget
"And having developed a multi-year forecast for the regional economy, we then use the outputs of that model to, to develop forecasts of revenue. We have historical data that show how the city's revenues correlate to things like income and employment within the region. To begin that process, though, we start with a national forecast.",budget
"So we have a national forecast, company, IHS market. And when we purchase forecasting services, and that's become the basis for our regional forecast. And again, the regional forecast for our revenue forecast.",budget
"I'll talk as we move through that, there are actually three different scenarios that we model out. And then we have made it, and both continue as things go forward to make a recommendation about which of those scenarios most appropriate for the, to, to base the city's budget process on in any given year. So diving in and starting with the economic update.",budget
"Stepping back some and expected perhaps to be in the economy. We've engaged in robust recovery. Significant other world events, however, have, have interrupted that process.",budget
"If that was what we had expected in particular, the war in Ukraine. And I'm going to talk about it here in terms of its economic consequences. It's human consequences are probably more important, but in the context of this work, we really do need to think about its economic impacts.",budget
And they are very significant. So supply chain disruptions are constraining. Manufacturing is noted here.,budget
"Food production, both Ukraine and Russia were major. Food commodity producers. That's creating escalating prices, the disruption there and supply.",budget
We only need to go to the local gas station to see how energy prices. Are hitting home for many and. And hitting and hitting personal budgets as well.,budget
So. Those are all issues that are creating significant uncertainty and you'll see this highlighted in both the national forecast and our forecast. Significant concern about where.,budget
The war in Ukraine may be taking us in terms of its economic impact. One thing that we definitely know has happened and it started actually. Before the war.,budget
"And that was an increase in inflation. It has rapidly accelerating actually, since we developed this presentation, there was another month worth of inflation data recorded and we hit another 40 plus year high in terms of the trends on inflation. So.",budget
So clearly there's a great deal of uncertainty around Ukraine. And we'll talk more about it at the various impacts. That all said.,budget
"The darker lines are the most recent history, the lighter lines are the previous, the great recession. Again, tracking your loss of jobs. And then the regaining of those jobs.",budget
"We were in the bottom half of 2020. So over the second half of 2020, which is essentially year one here. And then into 2021, we were somewhat below.",budget
"In fact, 30,000 jobs. That's what the red bar here at the top shows. But it is certainly true that it's been very uneven experience.",budget
"By sector. So the leisure. Leisure and hospitality sectors, so restaurants and hotels in particular continue to suffer.",budget
"So. They explain a lot of the job loss that we have experienced manufacturing, which includes Boeing here. Is it is another area.",budget
"Where we've seen a lot of unemployment. In particular, professional and business services and the information sector. The technology sector.",budget
"Within that have been producing an actual growth of jobs. And it's really the net impact of those is again, this loss of about 30,000 jobs, but without the. Growth in the technology sector.",budget
"Obviously the employment impacts would be, would have been larger here. So. I'm.",budget
"Talking a little bit more about the, about the national economy and the forecast. And the range of forecasts that we have. I'm going to talk a little bit about these pictures just to explain them.",budget
We have two graphics. One is about GDP. The other is about employment.,budget
"And again, they show the history through. Beginning of late last year, beginning of this. And then the projections.",budget
"The first one. Is the. Is the previous baseline forecast, but there is reference.",budget
"The other three lines show the range of the forecast. In particular, the. Again, the spread.",budget
"Pink line. Each is the baseline forecast. The yellow line is the optimistic and the darker one, the pessimistic.",budget
One is that. The. The baseline remains roughly the same.,budget
"There's some, some slight change, but the general trajectory of the economy relative to last fall is about the same. However, there is increasing concern and. Increasing risk on the pessimistic side in particular.",budget
And. The potential downturn. Has also increased.,budget
So the upside isn't a whole lot. A whole lot stronger than the baseline. But it isn't hard.,budget
"You know, it's hard to imagine things getting worse. So that as we think about budgeting processes and allocation of resources, that's something to keep in mind. I will preview that.",budget
"Our recommendation is to stick with the baseline scenario, but we should do so with the awareness about other potential outcomes. We then, as I described, take that national forecast and translate it into a regional forecast. So that we can, you know, we can see that there is a pattern that is that the upside isn't a whole lot better than the baseline.",budget
"But there is significant risk in the pessimistic forecast. And here we're showing employment on the left. And again, you can see that.",budget
"Broadcast of the forecast council. The recommendation as director Noble just noted for the council was the baseline forecast. And then at the end of the presentation, we did accept the recommendation from the forecast council office.",budget
"And then at the end of the presentation, we did accept the baseline forecast. So if you'd like to keep that in mind, as you consider questions, and look at these charts, that would be helpful. Thank you for that.",budget
"Yes. And on the right, we're showing. Per capita personal income.",budget
"And again, you'd see the same variation across the scenarios. One point I wanted to make there just to give you a sense of both. Challenges in forecasting.",budget
It might seem a little odd that there are two different lines for the historic data on personal income. And that's one of the challenges. And that's one of the challenges that we had to address.,budget
So if you look back for 2022. And what happened there is that there was a correction in the data that were provided to us. At the state level.,budget
And that's one of the challenges we have. So we then had to rerun the models. Given this.,budget
"This new data and update them accordingly. Just a technical point, but when I thought I'd just briefly highlight. The, the, the, the increasing issue of concern in terms of the overall economics.",budget
And also in terms of city's revenues and the city budget process expenditures as well. We all inflation has started to pick up last fall. And the expectation then.,budget
So this is when we were developing the forecast for November. The expectation. And it's actually shown in this lower lighter pink line.,budget
Was that inflation would pay in early 2022 and then begin to fade. And that's what we did. And we had incorporated it essentially into our local model.,budget
I would suggest that these numbers might even be a little bit higher. Is both that inflation. Is peaking.,budget
To a higher level than had been originally anticipated. And that it's duration is going to be longer. So it does not look as transitory as had been expected.,budget
"Again, the war in Ukraine is, is explaining at least. Some of that, some of that effect. The other significant driver though, I just wanted to highlight this and it's shown in the chart on the right is housing costs.",budget
"In excess of 20% are what we saw last year. And that's obviously a key component of overall cost of living. See, there's a question for customer Nelson.",budget
"So you on the left of this slide, it's talks about increasing inflation, but it does look as though it's decreasing going forward in the baseline and in the October. Baseline. So can you clarify?",budget
"Yeah, again, the expectation is still that the forces that are driving inflation. Will not persist into the long run. A couple of issues there.",budget
"One is speculation about what will happen in the war in Ukraine. And obviously that's a political speculation is one of the challenges here is that it's not necessarily pure economic forces that are driving this, but the other is the response from the federal government. Excuse me from the federal bank.",budget
So the fed is increasing interest rates. Specifically in response to inflation. And so that then becomes a risk to the overall national economy.,budget
"So the dollars that we had available to help mitigate the impact. So that had this impact of, of priming the economy, but that won't be sustained. I mean, so there aren't continued payments into 2023 and beyond.",budget
"So the. The federal reserve is trying to manage, you know, the removal of that stimulus and how to sort of land the economy into a period of steady self-sustaining growth. And, but now the impacts of inflation are complicating that.",budget
"For sure. And one thing, a couple of things about that in terms of a revenue forecast. Inflation will have the effect of increasing the nominal value of our, of our forecast.",budget
"A lot of our, a lot of our revenues are percentage tax. So, you know, as the price of clothing goes up. The value of the sales tax on clothing increases.",budget
"So some of what will drive. Growth unanticipated previously on forecast growth in the. Our revenues is this inflation, but the flip side of that is the city's cost.",budget
"And the director Dingley will have more to say about this. The city's cost will be driven by that same, those same inflationary factors. So the cost of labor in particular for city workers as, as an example.",budget
"So. It is both good news in terms of nominal value, but you need to consider the overall picture really to, to get to the bottom of things, if you will. Yeah.",budget
"Thinking about time moving forward as chairman Skater mentioned. We had, we had the forecast office recommended the baseline forecast. And in particular, we definitely, you know, I've highlighted the downside risk you saw in the pessimistic scenario.",budget
"True. We took a more conservative public health approach, but at that time, the pessimistic scenario made sense. Currently the risk to the economy are not.",budget
"I will take a minute to show you what. Some of the sensitivity to the different scenarios. So moving forward, not to talk specifically about, about revenues.",budget
"As chairman Skater mentioned, the forecast office is responsible for a share, but not all of the city's revenue. In particular, we're involved in forecasting. So we're responsible for a share, but not all of the city's revenue.",budget
Therefore it makes sense for us to be forecasting the variables that are most dependent on those regional economic variables. Other things like fees. Individual departments charge or things that depend on the rates they charge.,budget
Make more sense for the budget office to do because those are much more policy driven. Revenues really. So we're responsible for sales.,budget
Overall revenues here represent more than a billion dollars. So it's very significant share of a city's revenue. I'm going to get it.,budget
"Recall that last year, 2021 was the first year of that that that tax was in effect. The payments were all made at the end of the year. We actually, they weren't due until the end of January.",budget
"Some nervous days for some of us in February as those payments were processed. Ultimately the forecast. Excuse me, the actual revenues.",budget
Significantly exceeded our forecast. And that's because we didn't know the tax base. We didn't know how much money we were going to make.,budget
"And then the final total was 248 million. Again, not ideal to have been that far off. In our defense, if you will.",budget
This is a tax. For which we had very little information going in. We did not know the tax base.,budget
"More than $150,000. So I add to that just very briefly. I think that.",budget
"The office of forecast. Engage with the employment security department on a, to develop a data sharing agreement to help refine these estimates going forward. Another thing that will help us at least a little bit is that in 2022.",budget
Payments will be made quarterly. So payments will be due very shortly. They do the month.,budget
"Won't ask to be representative of what we have going forward. We'll be able to glean obviously some information for it from it, but generally expect this year to be one of transition. So, you know, we're not going to be able to be representative of what we have going forward.",budget
"And that's going to be affecting this, this, this revenue stream. Significantly. So.",budget
"It gives you a sense of, again, I just want to emphasize there was going to be uncertainty going forward on this as well. We don't have full information. And the landscape is changing as the nature of work, if you will, is also changing.",budget
"In terms of the different scenarios, at least. For the three of the largest revenue streams, BNO tax. Retail sales.",budget
"Payroll. You can see for 2023, just single year. But forecast year, what the difference would be.",budget
"If you add that all up, you know, for a few minutes. The last bullet makes this point that for 2022 and 23, 23 together, The potential risk. For 2022.",budget
"For 2022 would be $30 million lower and for 50. For 2023 would be $54 million lower. So it is in total a significant, significant variation.",budget
"But just again, just to highlight some of the potential risk there. Before I get to a summary of the revenues, just say a few things about some of the other sources that we are forecasting. The first one is.",budget
We're expecting to see a significant increase in our own revenues. These are private utility taxes. For both natural gas and steam escalating energy prices against one of these inflationary effects could help increase our revenues.,budget
"And we're expecting that going forward. Not they're not huge drivers of the overall revenue picture, but nonetheless, it gives you that background. The second one is.",budget
"Rather than communicating by voice. So. Again, in total, they're about 15 million each.",budget
That's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. It's a long standing and steady pattern at this point.,budget
Forecasting strong revenues for 2022. In the longer run. And this gets back to a point that was made about federal reserve policy behaviors.,budget
Is interest rates increase. There is expectation that level of transactions may decline. Access to capital.,budget
Becomes more costly as interest rates go up. I'm diving in now to actually show you the revenue forecast here. Let me walk through this.,budget
"Table of a lot of, a lot of numbers here. So. The first column is showing you these again, these are the revenues that we forecast.",budget
"Top part of the table, just the general fund revenues. The lower part of the tables, non-general fund revenues. Which are constrained or not in various ways.",budget
I'll touch on them briefly. This first column is the 2021 actual shown really for reference more than anything else. For 2022.,budget
"We're showing you the November forecast. So that's the one to which this year's budget is balanced. So again, Sometimes people forget this that when you approve the budget in the fall, You're balancing it to a forecast.",budget
If that for those forecast revenues for 2022. Don't emerge at the level that we anticipated their potential need to reduce spending. And you'll see this case here at the revenue forecast is up as potentially additional resources in 2022.,budget
So the second column is now the current April forecast. That's the updated figures. And then the.,budget
"The next column, the fourth column over is the difference. So this highlights how much things have changed since you approved the budget. Again, for this 2022 year.",budget
And then we have 2023 and 2024. So you're. Is the fall comes.,budget
The mayor will propose a biennial budget. 2023 and 2024. So.,budget
"These are really the key numbers. So, you know, you're looking at the revenue side that we're producing. For your budget process.",budget
"Updated for 22 and then looking ahead for the upcoming biennium. And just moving down here at top to bottom. You know, taxes.",budget
"Again, the overall sentiment is the economy has improved somewhat relative to our expectations in the fall. And also inflation is accelerating. So it's not a surprise that that's down just slightly.",budget
"The retail sales, criminal justice is a share of a county wide tax that is awarded to us. So again, it's up as well, slightly. On the utility taxes side, I mentioned that overall there's a decline in the cable television revenue.",budget
"Showing an increase in for April, in part, because. Payments that were. It should have been made in 2021 arrived late and are not going to be happening in 2022.",budget
"It's really a technical issue. So again, minor, minor differences there in these, in these areas. The difference overall, again, For the general fund for relative to our November forecast is just over $30 million.",budget
"30.25 million. That's net increased for this set of revenues. Director Dingley will give you a bit, a sense of the additional of the other revenues and also a sense of the expenditure side.",budget
"Looking quickly just to correct that at 32.5. I'm not going to go line by line, but just highlighting that we are seeing continued growth. Well, again, it is modest growth.",budget
"Employment growth. And income is picking up, but there are a variety of factors that are constraining overall growth. Thanks for her.",budget
"Sort of preparing us. For some decisions related to the 2022 budget in preparation. For the 20, 23, 24 budget.",budget
"Is it, would it be. Useful to know the 2021 actuals against. The council endorsed budget.",budget
"Because it would suggest, I think that there's, there'll be some carryover funds for 2020. From 2021. That we should be considering. Yeah.",budget
"So totally fair point. And in fact, the very first meeting of the forecast council, which was in March. So essentially a month ahead of the April, we did provide exactly that comparison of the 2021 actuals to the forecast.",budget
"And it did show that the 2020 actuals were slightly ahead of our, of the forecast. As director Dingley moves on to her presentation, I suspect you will see that. Certainly you will see that accounted for as well.",budget
"So. We were, we had, we had the forecast council. I'd seen that in a separate presentation.",budget
"Sorry, that wasn't a very clear answer to get to council member Herbold's. Question the 2021 actuals, but we'll be using that to update the city's financial plan and also will inform your decisions about the carry forward. Ordinance that the committee will be discussing.",budget
"Yeah, later in may. So first we'll do an updated financial plan that will give you an understanding of how those decisions impact 23 and 24. And then you'll be asked to consider that that legislation later in May.",budget
"General fund increase. Is it around five, six, four, three. Yeah.",budget
"So. To these numbers here, 5.6%. Increase from, you know, on forecasts from November.",budget
We're 32 million. Is that. I understood the question.,budget
"I think important to recognize that we had been in a. Period of 10 years of expansion, but, and we, and I'd have to go back and look at the actual numbers. And again, These are a subset of the overall general fund. Inflation.",budget
"But growth in the five to 6% range. Again, with the healthy economy we had were, were relatively consistent with what we had been seeing. Maybe a little bit lower.",budget
"Because again, recall that we were in a period of inflation of barely 2% so that, you know, real growth of 2% on top of inflation and 2% gets you to like four. Right. So.",budget
"You know, I think it's important to recognize that we had been in a period of inflation of barely 2% so that, you know, real growth of 2% on top of inflation and 2% gets you to like four. Right. So.",budget
"Part of the reason that the revenue forecast is up for 2022. Is that the inflation forecast is up. So that will bring in more nominal dollars, but depending on what happens with the city's costs, it may not buy you more services.",budget
"Those kinds of growth rates, You know, you're going to be able to see a little bit more of a net increase. And again. We give you a better sense of where things sit overall and what the projected shortfall is.",budget
"Relative. As you compare expenditures to these, to these revenues. So what is the overall revenue gap then?",budget
"Line of questioning and it is important though, colleagues that we have separate presentations because the office of economic and revenue forecast is an independent office. You know, not under the purview of the executive or the city council. So we wanted to make sure to specifically have time carved out for this presentation.",budget
"Please, thank you. Yeah. I've asked this question before, and I forget what the answer, as it relates to the hospitality. Or the leisure and hospitality category.",budget
And arts and culture is. Often lumped in with hospitality when you hear that talking point. So I just want to understand whether or not arts and cultural workers are included in that particular category.,budget
As it relates to what our projections are about. The likely recovery. In jobs for people who are paid the lowest wages.,budget
"Is significantly different on the, from the. The October and March baselines in the March. Optimistic scenario.",budget
"To the uncertainties around Ukraine that, you know, if the, and the potential for that to ripple across the global economy and then the national economy. So again, I think none of us know how that will obviously don't know how that will play out, but the impacts have been significant again, on economic grounds and could grow. Could grow quickly.",budget
"Also related to how the fed. The federal reserve response to increasing inflation and. You can miss a lot of history, but back to the early eighties.",budget
"There was a recession, a vocal recession, where the, you know, In order to control inflation, but increased interest rates to very high levels and really forced the economy into a period of contraction. So those are scenarios that are. Layered into that possible alternative.",budget
"So again, just to highlight. If things turn bad, they could go very bad. If you will.",budget
"Leisure and hospitality employment figures. And then also what information we have about job. Job losses essentially by, by.",budget
"Income or wage levels. So in terms of leisure and hospitality, yes. In terms of employment, yes.",budget
"In terms of employment, yes. Our part of the leisure and hospitality sector, the employment. Of.",budget
Accommodation food services is about. About 80% and the arts and recreation is about 20% of that leisure and hospitality sector. In terms of information regarding.,budget
"Slightly better. But those are still just overall. Employment figures by industry, not separated by income levels.",budget
"And then we'll bring our. Three into the record and have this segment presented so that we can see a fuller picture. Item number three, see budget office revenue update April, 2020 for B. 2022 for briefing discussion.",budget
"So thank you for having us as the chair mentioned, we're going to be looking at the general fund and non-general fund revenues for which CBO produces the forecast. As well as provide you with the full picture of revenue, incorporating the forecast offices revenues that you just saw from director noble. I'm joined today by Dave Hennis, who CBO is revenue lead.",budget
"Dave will be presenting the bulk of the update to you this morning. We also have CBO analyst, Alex, Jane and Joe Russell here to help answer questions. I will pick up toward the end to show the summary table for all the revenues, as well as talk through these revenues in context.",budget
"So what do these mean and what, what do we not know yet because we don't have the information here. So speaking of that context, as was raised under director noble's presentation and by the chair, just now with this presentation, you'll have the full revenue picture, but keep in mind, I am not going to give you updates about the expenditure side of the equation today. That's not the subject of this presentation.",budget
"It's going to be the subject of the May 4th presentation. So you will hear much more about that overall balancing picture in two weeks. So with that, everything else that I was going to cover has already been set.",budget
"Chair Mosqueda and council members look forward to this next 20 minutes or so to present the general fund revenues and some other fund revenues as forecasted by CBO. And I thought it might be helpful to begin by talking about which revenues we're talking about that are forecasted by CBO relative to the office of economic and revenue forecast. We have general fund revenues and we have other fund revenues, non-general fund revenues that we are forecasting and projecting.",budget
"And I think it's important to reiterate the notion that a lot of these revenues are revenues that the departments themselves perhaps forecast and that CBO is actually compiling them and, and at times working with the department to, to, to project revenues. And, and that's sort of why they're in CBO as, as director Noble mentioned. So we have property taxes and as you can see that we, we rely on the inputs from the office of economic and revenue forecast for the new construction forecast and the assessed value forecast, which is largely the basis of the, of the property tax forecast.",budget
"Talk about. On the left hand side in the gray pie slices, you see the. Office of economic and revenue forecast.",budget
"General fund. Revenues. Notice the payroll defense tax is not in, in this pie.",budget
"And, and that. And then. Up above you see in the upper right, the property taxes we've sort of pulled that out to signify that that's not in the city budget.",budget
"That's not in the city budget. That's really a revenue that's driven by the forecast offices inputs. But, but.",budget
"It's in terms of who's responsible for producing that final number that's on the CBO side. Altogether that the gray side, so to speak, the forecast office size about 64% of the 2022 revised. And then.",budget
"So, so about 36%. Covered by CBO. Thank you.",budget
"And so a little bit of context about the forecast we're about to talk about. The main thing that's happened over these past couple of years, there's just been extreme volatility. And that volatility is due to a variety of sources, not just economic factors.",budget
"There's, there's no reason to believe this might not continue. And so we, we want to just forewarn everybody. That we're still in a period of, of, of pretty dramatic changes going on.",budget
And so just trying to. Capture and predict all these effects. Are are difficult.,budget
"But those are the kinds of things that make it volatile and difficult to forecast in this, in this time. And then I wanted to say that. This forecast April forecast does benefit from having the impact of the actual 2021 revenues.",budget
And so there's some negative numbers ahead of. On a future slide. That that.,budget
And so that's a factor. Next slide. So here's the revenue table.,budget
"These are just the general fund revenue tables that CBO forecast. And I want to talk through a few of the, of the, of the issues. The next slide, slide six.",budget
"That's the 22 April revised forecast relative to the 20, 22 adopted forecast. And so you see it. And then we have the.",budget
To get a corrected. A version of this presentation with the corrected 2021 actuals. Numbers.,budget
Okay. So. Focusing first on 2022.,budget
In. Of in 2021. To a rate of 24.8 cents.,budget
"And depending on Seattle's AV growth, we may see another year or so, which I forecasted out there in 23 and 24. Of decline in the, in the medic one EMS levy. And so that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's what's driving the rate change.",budget
"Was, was a bit lower. So we've rebased the forecast. And, and applied our growth rates.",budget
And then the revenue stream. For parking meters. Is down 3.2 million.,budget
"That's largely due to. The planned rate increases that got shifted from December to April of 2022. So they're going into effect soon, if not already happening.",budget
And so that just drops that revenue stream. The rates currently are about 58%. And that's largely due to.,budget
The driving decreases. In that revenue stream or a slower. Rate of increase.,budget
A lower amount of volume. Grants. And then.,budget
"Transfers. The transfers are important here because as you look into the out years, you see large drops in transfers, and that has to do with a one-time transfers occurring in that occurred in 21 and 2020. 22. That includes the $64.2 million of.",budget
Transfer of jumpstart payroll expense tax monies into the general fund. To the tune of about $85.4 million. That.,budget
"Increase the 2022 amount relative to what's going to happen in 2023 and 2024. All else is a big category. It's it's got a lot of ups and downs, but, but nothing.",budget
"Well, actually I'm sorry. $65 million of the Mercer property sales proceeds. But some other categories.",budget
"Their interest earnings they're up perhaps about $800,000. Due to expected increases in. Interest rates.",budget
"And modest increased perhaps in, in the next year. And then the general fund. Their excise taxes are up about 1.1 million.",budget
"So that gives you a total change for the general fund of about $4.1 million to the negative. Which director Dingley will show you. In the combined table, how that all adds up.",budget
"I think. I think then going out to 23 and 24, you see the changes and there, there are significant. Increases in interest rates.",budget
"And, and the one time, the one time issues. So that brings us to the non general fund. Fund items.",budget
"They're at about 59% of 2019 levels. And so while we're seeing this revenue stream sort of hold. It's it's, it's got a ways to go.",budget
"Again, driven by what we expect to see. In terms of, of return to office. It's critical here.",budget
"Five of those are new since October, November, 2021. And the other two are. Are projected, but have been delayed.",budget
And so you're seeing a drop in revenues there as we lose the revenues from about four cameras. Plus. Yeah.,budget
And then the. The vehicle license fee is just a small adjustment based on. So with that.,budget
I noticed that this is. Do we handle our other automated. Camera revenue differently.,budget
"So, yeah, so the school zone cameras are tracked in a fund. So that's why they're here on this list. The red light cameras are part of the general fund.",budget
"And so that amount is up in the general fund, except for the 20% that council designated should go to. The fund that the, the, the, the school zone cameras are in. And so this is not a revenue.",budget
"Thank you for that. And then we are tracking the others, but the other, the other. Camera revenues go into other funds as well.",budget
"Goes into our fiscal reserves, right? Yeah. So for mosquito, the 85.4 million of, from the jumpstart fund to the general fund for the 2022 budget was into the general fund to support general general fund.",budget
"And then the other portion of that went into the reserves, which is not shown here. Great. Okay.",budget
"So this is showing the amount that went into the general fund. And then the, the other portion of that went into the reserves, which is not shown here. The, this is for the 2022 allocations, not the 21.",budget
"Actuals. Which we'll talk more about at the next meeting, but some, some of the 21. Actuals were, were used to replenish fiscal reserves and per policy, because the 21 revenues go into the general fund.",budget
"A portion of those would also go back. To help, excuse me. To replenish the general fund.",budget
"And then the other portion of that went into the reserves, which is not shown here. The, this is for the 2022 allocations, not the 21. Actuals, which we'll talk more about at the next meeting, but some, some of the 21.",budget
"One actuals were, were used to replenish fiscal reserves and. Per policy. So some of those would also go back.",budget
"To help, excuse me, rebuild our fiscal reserves. Yes. Great.",budget
I believe this is the full picture. The full April revenue update that includes revenues forecast by director. Noble's team that you'd heard in the first presentation. Those are here represented in the gray shaded lines.,budget
"And as well as the ones that Dave just pointed out. Great job, Dave. On all of the CBO forecasted revenues.",budget
"And as you can see that combined change in 2022 revenues in the general fund. Is an increase of 25 and a half million relative to the 2022 adopted budget. This, the other thing I wanted to mention with this table is as Dave mentioned previously, it's worth highlighting.",budget
"That there is a significant drop in the 20 from 2022 revised to the 2023 forecast. And that's driven by large changes in those, those one-time transfers and the all else category. From the loss of the proceeds from the Mercer mega block sale and other one-time significant transfers that were a part of that 2022.",budget
Forecast overall. So a general fund. Is an increase of 25 and a half million relative to the 2022 adopted budget.,budget
"This, the other thing I wanted to mention with this table is as Dave mentioned previously, it's worth highlighting. That there is a significant drop in the 20 from 2022 revised to the 2022 forecast. And that's driven by large changes in those one-time transfers and the all else category.",budget
"From the Mercer mega block sale and other one-time significant transfers that were a part of that 2022. Forecast overall. So adjusting for those one-time sources, 23 GF.",budget
General fund revenues are projected to increase five and a half percent over 2022. And growth in 2024 is projected to slow approximately. To approximately 2.8% considering all sources.,budget
Indulge me in the belt and suspenders approach here. If we can go to the next slide. So this revenue forecast provides the basis for us working to develop a balanced 2023 and 24 proposed budget.,budget
The proposed budget budget will also be informed by an updated forecast in August and the ultimate adopted budget informed by an updated forecast in November. And as was mentioned at the top. Revenues are only half of the picture here.,budget
"Expenditures also matter. And as you heard from director Noble, inflation is now at a 30 year high and it affects both revenues and expenditures. Rising prices boosts inflation-based taxes, such as sales tax.",budget
"So it drives up those numbers. But it also puts pressure on the buying power for wages and commodities set another way. We have more money, but everything costs more.",budget
"So it might, it's sort of cautious guarded optimism. As we go into the future into planning. So.",budget
"We are also, this also affects. The city's labor contracts, many of which are open and negotiations are ongoing. So all of the city's costs.",budget
Is outpacing the revenue growth. So that leads to structural deficits or gaps in the general fund. And with the one-time sources.,budget
"Already mentioned that are no longer available in 2023. That leads us to the conversation we've been having about, about how to move forward. And that's going to be the subject of that May 4th conversation at the, the next finance meeting, when we give a more.",budget
Wholesome or fulsome rather. General fund balancing update with central staff and CBO. How much do you mind pausing here for a second?,budget
"Two weeks from now with that fuller picture for what this means for current expenses and also for a six-year lookout. So that is why it's a part one today, part two on May 4th. I know there's probably a lot of eagerness though, to see how those expenses factor in.",budget
"As director Dingley noted, we are working with CBO to update the six-year financial plan. Making sure that we on both in the legislative branch and the executive branch. We are working with CBO to update the six-year financial plan, making sure that we are on both the.",budget
Revenue side and the expenditure side also factoring in. Potential decisions around the carry forward. Ordinance.,budget
"And so that will indicate on May 4th, it will give you a update on where, what we are projecting in terms of the gap between general fund and the general fund. And then on May 4th, it will give you an update on where we are in terms of the budget. And so what we will do is this is the first of three forecast updates that the council will receive prior to adopting a budget.",budget
"This fall and given some of the uncertainty, these numbers may continue to fluctuate. So what we will be discussing on May 4th is both the updated. Number. We will also likely present some scenarios of like what, if.",budget
"And then on May 4th, we will be discussing some of the strategies that the council and the mayor may want to consider. To inform the budget deliberations this fall, but also spending decisions that will come up during 2022 in June, we expect to receive the mid year supplemental budget. Ordinance for example.",budget
"And then on May 4th, we will be discussing some of the strategies that the council may want to consider. On a regular basis as we're receiving these revenue forecasts and in the context of the council's budget decisions. So hopefully in the, the long-term we will avoid.",budget
"In looking at these financial plans, I would, I would like to point out that the, the economic and revenue projections that we've covered today. Property taxes, sales taxes, and BNO taxes specifically. Are actually projected to be higher in 2023.",budget
Then they were projected to be. In the fall of 2019. So there is a divergence in the economy that has not quite converged largely due to work from home and things of that nature. So I just want to say thank you for that.,budget
"You know, we talk about biannual budgeting, but. You know, in all actuality, we have a 12 year, a 12 month calendar budget. And so we have a lot of work ahead of us.",budget
"I think the presentation on the fourth, that we'll do a real public presentation on what the six year. Look, you know, outlook looks like. Will help us create a greater stability in terms of our budgeting processes for them, not just the next two years, but looking over the course of that.",budget
Six years to come and how we can create greater stability and revenues. I think this is going to lead to. I think this is going to lead to.,budget
I think this is going to lead to. I think this is going to lead to. I think this is going to lead to a more accountable budgeting process.,budget
Nine from the presentation. That's the one that has. All of the revenues.,budget
"Which you can get from the, I think I had to go to the budget archives and then there's an appendix. I think it's page 705 or the appendix. But it's showing total revenues of about 1.4 million.",budget
"And so, and this is even before, including the new payroll tax. Because of all the great needs that we have. So. May 4th.",budget
"We'll be, we'll be vital in terms of how we're going to. How are we going to live within our means spend within our means with our budget. I did want to try to unpack a couple lines that we were able to.",budget
So. May 4th. We'll be. We're going to be spending a lot of money.,budget
And we're going to be spending a lot of money on our budget. I did want to try to unpack a couple of line items here. There.,budget
"And I know it's hard to fit everything into a PowerPoint. And to compare apples to apples, but the two line items one is called transfers and the other is called all else. And when we see the revenue, We're going to be spending a lot of money on our budget.",budget
"So I'm just curious how we're getting from. 187 million going down to 27 million and then 156 million going down to 95 million. If that could be explained today, that'd be great.",budget
So in the 187 million of transfers in the 2022 revised column. Or about $150 million. Worth of one-time transfers.,budget
They're they're one-time sources. That just won't be available. As well as the 65 million from the.,budget
Or some mega block sale that shows up in 2022. So those. Those one-time transfers and all else are really buoying.,budget
"The 22 revenues. And they're not a part of the base revenue forecast that we would expect that we could apply. You know, inflation or the other economic factors to, to develop the following year's forecast.",budget
"Madam chair, if I may follow up. When you say the jumpstart will not be available. It's an ongoing revenue source.",budget
"So why would it not be available? As a revenue, as a, as a revenue to the general fund. So in starting in 2022.",budget
"In 2023. That transfer is no longer in place. It is fully its own fund and is, is.",budget
"We're codified into statute. And then just very briefly, because I know we have other hands up at alley. It's just that the, the, the, the percentages that are allocated in the original spending plan are going to be lower than anticipated.",budget
"As Julie described in 2022 that the, the payroll tax revenues go into their own fund and their policies codified in law that dictates how that. That those revenues can be spent. Consistent with the spending plan adopted when the council was considering.",budget
"The general fund. And there was a, there was a, there was a budget proposal that said if general fund revenues. Drop below a specific amount, it's like 1.51 billion, I believe.",budget
"Then the difference between the current forecast and that number. Can be transferred into the general fund. So for 20, for the 2022 budget, when the council was considering.",budget
That budget this past fall. The general fund. Projections are above that amount.,budget
And so the current policy would not allow for any transfer from the jumpstart fund. To the general fund for 23. And beyond.,budget
And the caveat on that. And this initial revenue projection. Correct.,budget
"The question of sort of fixating on numbers and the advice that, that we don't do so because we are going to be getting future forecasts. I just want to clarify. There's also, as I alluded to earlier.",budget
My fixation on numbers is really related to what's happening this year. With the councils. There is sort of this ongoing conversation about where we need to do spending pauses.,budget
"And so when I'm, when I'm trying to get at. The council priorities in, in our, in our, in our budget. I may continue to, to zone in on, on, on spending pauses.",budget
"And so when I'm, when I'm trying to get at those specific numbers, it's part of it is about my interest in advocating for spending on the council priorities in our, in our, in our budget. So I may continue to, to, to zone in on, on some of those questions with, with the full understanding that the 2023 picture is going to be informed by future forecasts. My question is going back to the, the, what does it all mean slide and the recognition that in place, inflation affects both revenues and, and expenditures.",budget
"I'm assuming they don't impact both equally, or else it would just be a wash. And I don't think it is a wash. So I'm just wondering, how do you account for the impact of inflation and how should we, what, what are sort of the principles going into that suggestion?",budget
"That we need to be considering how inflation impacts revenues and expenditures. It's a great question, Councilmember. It's the question that I think is at the top of all of our minds.",budget
"So when we are pulling in more dollars in a nominal sense because of inflation, right? Everything is costing more. So the sales tax percentage is generating more revenue.",budget
"So that that comes in. It costs more for people to go about their lives. And when those costs reach a certain point, it will change.",budget
"I don't know if you have other things that you would add. No, just that the. That the expenditures that go into the budget are are are distinct to the city, right?",budget
"And so the wages that, you know, go into the city. And so while there is the general notion of inflation, the actual costs that are going to be captured over the course of the summer and into the fall of what actual costs are going to be projected by departments will be will be different. And so I don't know that there are principles of the budget.",budget
"And so while there is the general notion of inflation, the actual costs that are going to be captured over the course of the summer and into the fall of what actual costs are going to be projected by departments will be will be different. And so I don't know that there are principles of of how you manage that other than to keep your information as updated as possible along the way. And one other thing that I would add is that the increase in costs is not just limited to inflation.",budget
"It's also with our supply chain issues as well. So, although we might see inflation at 7%, we might have in a supply chain situation where it's difficult to get certain raw materials for our for our capital projects, the costs there because of that supply chain decrease in in supply might have significantly higher costs to acquire those materials. So it's it's it can be also a bit lumpy.",budget
"So I understand that you're saying we don't know. But you're making some assumptions for purposes of this projection. So I just want to understand are is is the assumption that the impacts are awash or is there an assumption that the cost to purchase goods is a greater increment than the, the increase in the value of our revenues, or the other way or I, I just I'm asking what the projections are based on.",budget
"I also see interim director Dingley that interest excuse me interim director Pinochet has her hand is raised as well just wondering if you want to. Please, I can go after you. You're free to enter that welcome to invite you to answer that specific question what I was going to know is, and Director noble may be able to speak to the work that their office did on providing some inputs in terms of the inflation assumptions for the for the forecast side of the equation that will also inform expenditure discussions but the financial plan includes assumptions and so we will do our best to highlight those assumptions when we were presenting the forecast.",budget
"In a couple of, excuse me the financial plan in a couple of weeks including where that where it's not just a wash between assumptions around the revenues and the expenditures to highlight sort of how that is maybe a bigger impact for for the city that it that it's impacting expenditures for example, in our assumptions more than revenues if that is the case. Thank you for that let's let's make sure that this is a key piece that we come back to in the. In the presentation on five four.",budget
"Sorry. Yes, so they're, they're up over 2021, but they're down compared to our initial projections. Exactly.",budget
"And they're down relative to 2022 adopted. Okay, so they're not up over the 2021. Correct.",budget
"We will have this, the most much anticipated part two of the general fund balancing analysis, this will be an update of our six year financial plan. Again, that meeting is going to be on May 4. All right, hearing nothing for the good of the order we did it pretty much on time.",budget
"I'm probably going to follow up with you to ask a little bit more about your budget and might even ask you to come back to share more about kind of the mechanics of how the PDA is funded and how you use that money to do the kinds of purchasing that you're talking about. We did talk about this a little bit just a couple weeks ago, and I know those are, that's information that you're still trying to pull together. You just had a retreat.",budget
We'll have a briefing on the General Fund Balancing Analysis. This is our six-year financial plan. And a briefing on the Seattle Rescue Plan quarterly updates.,budget
"This is, if you will, part two of the conversation that we started in our committee meeting last week. Again, last week, we had the opportunity to hear from the CBO Director, Julie Dingley. And separately, we heard from Ben Noble, who's the Director of the Economic and Revenue Forecast.",budget
Those two presentations present part one of the analysis in terms of the revenue that's coming into the city. And then really the second and probably more interesting point for us in terms of our budget planning is gonna be part two. And that will be presented by Central Staff.,budget
"I can only hope during these trying times, at the very least, we can expect fiscal responsibility to be a part of your decision-making process. Have a good day. Thank you.",budget
"And I would anticipate that quarter two and quarter three to be higher than the current quarter based on the historical data that's presented. If I may please have slide two. It is also important to understand how the backlog grew to nearly 5,000 cases.",budget
"So this is going to cover the update between January and March and show how staffing has progressed. Allie, thank you. That's, this is the same chart that you have seen before.",budget
"And as it turns out, they're going to be getting only 98, they think, so far based on the information that they got in this first quarter. And so how does that pan out throughout the year? If you look at the rest of the year, what we see is that at the end of the year, there will be, Ali, go ahead and flip it.",budget
"And so that is the basic crux of this piece of legislation was a startup policy conversation and set the direction for meeting the need that I have just discussed. So, if we don't do this, what else are we going to do? $4.1 million is a lot of money.",budget
"This is not a shortfall in revenue necessarily, it's a gap in how fast revenues are keeping up with the inflating costs of services and the growing population across our city. So one of the most important things that I think we need to be looking at right now is how we address this gap and ensuring that we have the funding necessary for a robust budget for 2023 and 2024. This is an issue that we are gonna spend a lot of time talking about over the next six months, but we have to be both looking at preserving funding and any 2022 underspend, such as savings achieved through delayed hirings or any other underspends in 2022 for future investments in our two-year budget.",budget
"Again, this is kind of, it's not a specific calculation. Therefore, the range could be anywhere between what is currently proposed and what is requested on any one of those particular factors. Okay, so the next one that I wanted to discuss is number 11.",budget
And that would be for five distinct positions. The budget that OLS is proposing is outlined in the memo. So you can see all the different components of it.,budget
A central staff is not aware of current general fund resources available to support this expense absent an offsetting reduction in general fund appropriations. So there would be a need to identify resources for implementation of this bill. Some items to consider would be Office of Labor Standards civil penalties and fines.,budget
"If the director were to increase that annual contribution, it would mean that the appropriations from the BNO tax that are used for other items in the city's budget would need to be reduced. So that is something to consider if the sub fund is increased. Another possible idea is a fee on network companies.",budget
"Our adopted 2022 budget, which back in the day happened in may, which was a long way off when I started thinking about this in February. And I'm not budget chair. And I assume that list council resolutions provide a venue for articulating and debating our policy positions in the public eye.",budget
"And since January on SRP1 programs, there's been an additional $2.5 million in further activity between spending and encumbrances and other contracts or agreements that are in process that aren't in PeopleSoft, our accounting system yet. $8.3 million of this change is in more spending recorded. And you can see in this change from that yellow slice in the January column, reducing and turning into more blue and green, that's a change moving from in-process contracts to being now encumbered or spent.",budget
That's right. Okay. And can you confirm that that dollar amount is updated as of this presentation and what it might mean to not be in progress?,budget
"Thank you very much. You just said that you were going to talk about economic recovery section later. I'm zeroing in on the 45%, which is better than the 38%, which was in the slide that was on the agenda last time.",budget
"So I know that progress is being made and it's a challenge to get money out and encumber. So I just wanted maybe later in the presentation to talk about that number, 45%, and what we can expect in the next quarter or so. Thanks.",budget
"So as Chair Mosqueda noted, it's part of the 2022 budget and appropriated the second tranche of waiver funding. This shows the status in a similar way to SRP1, but a couple of things to note about what's different here. Much of the second tranche is allocated to pay for city staff over the next several years, carrying out things like the Queen City Initiative, administering the QFIR funds, doing evaluation, and implementing CIVIFORM.",budget
"Just a note there, it harkens back to the conversation that we had at the beginning of this when we invited national partners in to talk about what they saw from the last recession and the jurisdictions that invested in core government services saw faster recovery for both the private sector and continued employment and prosperity for the entire jurisdiction was more possible when those government services didn't see dramatic cuts. So I wanted to bring that up because it was two years ago now that we had some of those national presentations and the data was really clear from that first recession that we saw about 10 years ago. So I just wanted to tie in the nexus to the private market as well and our overall health of the local economy.",budget
Thanks for that question. On ESG funds and those other funds I'll need to defer to Joe first. Good morning Madam Chair.,budget
We have the executive's office has as well so it seems like there should be a path to making sure that they receive funding and perhaps in partnership with some additional federal funds that come later this year but we all I think are have have the same interests and funds available. So looking forward to getting that resolved. Director Panucci did you have anything you'd like to add to that?,budget
Some of the progress that's been made just isn't in the accounting system yet and isn't showing up in our monthly report. And one big example of that is the neighborhood economic recovery grants program. Our system shows you know it's maybe two-thirds encumbered in spend but it's actually entirely accounted for in OED's agreements with providers.,budget
So we expect to show more progress on these things by the August update. And another more technical reason why things may not be showing up is that it can take time between when a program is encumbered and then that provider invoices the city and the city makes a payment and that hits our books. So more to come as always.,budget
"So I'm just wondering, is the number 2 million or 1.4? I may have to get back to you about which items are being included in which total. All right.",budget
"Great, thanks. And then my last question, I'll come back to Councilmember Nelson. Specific to the concept about how do we get these dollars out faster, I'm also interested in that.",budget
"The asterisk says SRP3 also included 66.3 million in revenue replacement to the general fund. So offline, can you just tell me where that went or what that is backfilling? That can be just offline.",budget
"I'm not actually familiar with this particular use of Clifford dollars. We would need to look into that. I think maybe you mentioned it being considered for a hold, so it might be among the revenue replacement uses.",budget
"Yes, I just wanted to so the funding appropriated in the 2022 adopted budget was general fund, which is probably why William isn't specifically tracking that program. And we can follow up offline with Director Dingley on that, on those investments. Great.",budget
"As we teed up in the last presentation from the Finance and Housing Committee, this is really part two of the conversation that rounds out the fuller picture of not only revenue for 2022, 23, and 24, but really looking ahead. Six years ahead is what I really am excited about. If folks haven't had the chance to read the budget memo, please do.",budget
"It is 15 pages of very important information that's been provided from Tom Meisel and Ali Panucci. And it provides, I think, a transparent accounting of what to expect throughout 2022. As we look at the current budget situation, most folks have heard us in the last four months talk about what the current budget situation is and the gap between long-term needs and investments that we have prioritized and the amount of revenue that we have to meet those needs.",budget
"I appreciate it, and I just want you to all hear that directly from us as well. On page two and three of the memo, there are some key points that I want to highlight to note the importance of this presentation here today. On page two, the second paragraph, it really talks about the importance of having these conversations about a six-year financial plan in public in a transparent and accountable way early, prior to a budget being transmitted to the legislative branch for consideration and finalization, and in the memo, it notes that rather than a one-off ad hoc process, periodically reviewing the financial plan, it's optimal when a regular exercise can be embedded into the budget process, and that's exactly what I have asked Central Staff to do since becoming budget chair in 2020, and realizing that these six-year financial plans, or the six-year outlook, were really embedded into our budgets as appendices.",budget
"You'll note here in the Central Staff memo that on paragraph three, it said rather than using the plan as a guide for financial stability and discussions, which is what we will be doing going forward today, in the past, these financial plans were included as appendices in the budget, and the assumptions were used to generate these plans, and they were not really disclosed or discussed in a public way like they will be today and going forward. So this is a really fundamental conversation to make sure that there's good budgeting practice, that we have accountable and transparent conversations between branches of government, and that we're having a discussion with the public as well about how we look forward to good budgeting with you all in the future. I want to take a minute to, again, thank the transparency that has come from the City Budget Office, again, under the leadership of Director Dingley.",budget
"In fact, I think many of us are used to, on the legislative branch side, having options presented to us. We will talk about options in various scenarios, but that's not actually option in terms of an issue identification, you know, proposal that we're used to. This is really to tee up a discussion about how we can get to solid budgeting in the future that doesn't look at carryover dollars to sustain budgeting, that doesn't look at salary savings as a way to plug budget gaps, and looks at how we can create a really strong budget outlook for our city as we seek to recover from COVID.",budget
"So again, thank you very much for the work that's been done. No longer are you seeing a financial plan being sent down to us on page 665, quite literally, of last year's budget, or page 760 of the previous budget. This is really an opportunity for us to pull out that six-year plan, have a detailed discussion, and to then allow for that to really feed into creating a stable budget proposal that the mayor is currently working on in collaboration with the city budget's office that will then serve as the base for the legislative branch's deliberations later.",budget
"So I'm excited about this. I'm nerding out just a little bit over a six-year financial plan, but I hope you see why. And I think that the central staff budget memo has really articulated the importance of the ask that we made of central staff and the hard work that's gone in over the last two years to dissect this information and have a complete analysis here for us today.",budget
"So again, thank you, Director Dingley, for your partnership and collaboration, and thank you very much, Tom and Allie, for the hard work that you've done to provide this. This is just the beginning of the discussion, and as a reminder, as noted on the last page of the memo, this six-year financial plan will be updated every time we receive a revenue forecast. So the next one you will receive as an updated six-year financial plan analysis will be in August, and then after that again in November, but will be in the heart of budget deliberations at that time.",budget
"Just say it fills this budget manager's heart with joy when I hear people talking with such enthusiasm about a financial plan, so thank you for that. So I'm just going to provide some intro remarks and then turn it over to Tom, and then Director Dingley and myself will be here along the way to add additional context and to help answer questions. So since at least 2019, the General Fund financial plan has projected that General Fund expenditures are outpacing General Fund revenues.",budget
"You've heard us talking about this in various central staff memos this year, in presentations with the City Budget Office, and presentations to this committee as the projected gap between expenditures and revenues. For clarity, because this is a term more commonly used in fiscal policy discussions, our memo and presentation use the term deficit, but you'll hear us use gap or deficit interchangeably, so I just wanted to to highlight that. The projected gap or deficit, if you will, has become more pronounced in recent years as the impacts of to City revenues from the pandemic have been met with one-time funding solutions, as well as that structural problem that existed pre-pandemic.",budget
"Providing more consistent and ongoing review of these financial plans will really help us place your current budget decisions in the context of how those decisions impact the long-term sustainability of the General Fund. With this in mind, as Chair Mosqueda noted too, under her leadership, the Council in 2022 adopted Resolution 31954 that, among other things, requested that the City Budget Office, or CBO, provides the six-year financial forecast annually, including disclosure of all the embedded assumptions and agreements to share that data. This is another step in implementing that request.",budget
"So just not going to belabor the point, but just to echo it and lift that up. So if we could look at the next slide, we'll dive into the analysis of the General Fund Financial Plan. So in the upcoming slides, we'll be talking about some more complex topics that deal with financial planning in general.",budget
"Some of these will be familiar based on work in prior year budgets, though it's important to review them before we look in more detailed information that we'll talk about this morning. And by way of terms, one thing that will be discussed frequently is ongoing. And so in the context of the budget and a financial plan, that essentially is something that shows up in the budget each and every year.",budget
"So a good example of that is the salary cost for a regular, so non-temporary position that provides services in the budget. Each year in the financial plan will account for paying for the salary of that individual in the future. In contrast, there is the concept of a one-time item.",budget
"And so these are more discrete and time-limited in nature. Best way to think about this is a capital project, so something that you begin, you build the project, and then when the project is complete, you are done, and it no longer is in the budget as a significant item. Another example more in the operating budget is, say, a one-time program focused on providing a service in a specific year, sometimes given resource constraints, but sometimes with other considerations in mind that is not anticipated to continue in the future year budgets.",budget
And so this matters because another term is growth assumptions. And so these are the ways that the amounts that are in the current year budget are growing or grown in the future years. So the kind of one that comes to mind first is inflation.,budget
"So as prices go up, the cost of what government is purchasing increase because of inflation. And so in order to accurately measure the revenues that we're expecting to receive against the expenditures, we need to build in some level of growth to account for that expectation in the future. Next term, and Interim Director Pernucci discussed this, it's the kind of the pure financial concept of operating surplus or deficit.",budget
"And so this is really in simple terms the difference between the resources that we expect to get in the year by way of annual revenues and the expenditures on government services that we plan to make. So sometimes that gap can be negative where the expenditures are higher than the revenues we plan to receive. And other times the gap can be positive in the other direction, meaning revenues are higher than the expenditures we're going to make.",budget
"Another concept is one of reserves. And so in the context of the general fund financial plan, these are amounts that are items that the executive can generally expect to be including in the budget or in future budgets, but yet there is not exactly a specific legal obligation to do that. And if they did not account for this in some way, when the time comes to incur that obligation, the money would not be there to make the payment.",budget
"So these oftentimes will include legal and contractual items that are under negotiation. So the final amounts are not quite known at this time, but there is an estimate that is available and that estimate is used to account for that future obligation. And then the final term is fund balance.",budget
"And so the fund balance, the best way to think of this is this is the bookend of the city's finances for the year. So we start a fiscal year. We start a year with an amount in the fund, in the general fund.",budget
"We receive revenue, which adds resources that are available. The council makes appropriations and the department spend money against those appropriations, which reduce the level of resources. We account for the reserves, those future potential obligations.",budget
"And then at the end is what's left. So there's a beginning fund balance, the operations of government take place, and then there's an ending fund balance. And then that ending fund balance carries into the next year.",budget
"Thank you, Chair Mosqueda. And then some acronyms that I will possibly refer to throughout are GF, so that's general fund. CBO is the city budget office.",budget
"I'll just use financial plan instead of saying six-year financial plan, though that is technically how many years are included. And then IRF is the Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts. Okay, now we can go to the next slide.",budget
"Thank you. So some of this has already been covered in prior commentary, but what is a financial plan? So it is essentially a a table or a set of numbers that applies assumptions that we make to project what future revenues and expenditures will look like.",budget
"And in determining, making the decisions about what numbers to use, we also can reveal what the economic trends that are projected, what the impact those trends have on both budgets and revenues in the plan. When you look in the longer term, you can identify looming challenges or potential opportunities that give you more insight on the decisions that you're making in the current year. And so next, why do a financial plan?",budget
"And again, it's that. It's to recognize that there are future implications of the decisions that are being made in the now and how to recognize that those challenges or opportunities exist and strategize and have a better way to strategize the current year decisions with sight on the longer term. And also, it's kind of a process.",budget
"We'd love to move towards something that looks more like biannual budgeting. I'd also love to make sure that our fiscal notes, I know there's been some updates to the fiscal notes. Thank you very much, Council Member Peterson, for your past work on that.",budget
"I'm still interested in how we move towards fiscal notes that have a six-year outlook. Well, so that'd be looking over three biannual budgets, and we know that that is going to take some time and work to see how we can work in partnership with the departments and CPO as we develop legislation to really have that six-year outlook as part of legislation as well, but this is one component of a broader conversation that we've been having over the last two years as I've been budget chair about how to get the six-year look, not just for our budgeting discussions in the fall, but how we can do this on a routine basis with legislation as well. So those are some of the things that are still in the works, but that type of work on individual legislation in combination with a regular review of a six-year budgeting outlook I think will help provide a more complete analysis as we do the important work of governing for the City of Seattle.",budget
"Director Dingley, please go ahead. Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to highlight something that Tom said, that financial plans are a point in time, and so these numbers will naturally shift over time.",budget
"They're built on the best available information at the time they are created, so in some ways that can be unsatisfactory because not all the answers are available when it's being provided, but just something to keep in mind as you're working through this. And then real quick, if I may, I just wanted to go back to the comments at the top around how where this shows up in the budget. CPO has used financial plans to govern how we work with departments for as many years as I've been here and long before my time, and we obviously, this is a product that is for the public and for the Council to help us to help you understand what it is that we want to do and accomplish, and so we would be happy to continue to partner with you on how that information is presented.",budget
"As you know, it's very clear, previous agreements are not serving you very well, so we want to make sure that those are represented in a way that's useful to both you and the public, so thank you for that. Thank you. So now we'll start looking at the actual, some of the financial plans, both historical and the revised.",budget
"So, you know, beyond, you know, in future slides, or in fact, probably in this slide, we will hone in on the key details, but I just wanted to go real quick on how this works. So, again, going back to some of the terms I defined earlier, we start with a fund balance in 2020 for this, in this case, add in $1.4 billion of revenues. There was $1.5 billion of adopted expenditures, which was a gap of negative $19 million, bringing that original starting fund balance down to $59.6 million.",budget
"There were 59.6 or so million dollars worth of reserves that were accounted for, but yet not specifically budgeted, bringing the unreserved fund balance or the final ending fund balance to $13,000. So, that represents the balanced budget for 2020. And then moving into 2021, the starting fund balance is the ending budgetary fund balance, so not including the reserves, and then adds $1.46 million of revenue against $1.5 billion of expenditures.",budget
"And so, this is kind of the initial key takeaway of this slide, is that based on the projections at that time, so winter of 2019, the 2021 projection was showing a gap of negative $41 million. And based on the various assumptions that were being applied at that time, that gap was shown to persist in future years, showing about a $36 million gap in 2023. And then, you know, so that's the sort of longer-term sustainability.",budget
"And each one of those gaps then brings the projected ending fund balance down in the plan. So, given those negative operating gaps per year, the ending balance would have been negative $41, and then growing to negative $79, and then finally at the end of 2023, so at the end of this financial plan, it would have been showing a negative, or it did show a negative $116 million in the general fund. So, this is just to show that, again, based on a lot of, as Director Dingley noted, a lot of imperfect but best available information at the time, when the 2020 budget was adopted, it was projecting an operating gap of around $39 million and a final ending fund balance of $116 million.",budget
"And in the memo, it says that there was a known potential deficit or gap in revenue, known at least in 2019. And so, your slide here talks about the 2020 adopted budget, and just for way of reminder to the public as well, the 2020 adopted budget is actually deliberated in the fall prior. So, this is the 2019 actions that were taken before I was also budget chair as well.",budget
"So, when you see the adopted budget that was deliberated and discussed in 2019 and going forward. Okay. Thank you.",budget
"We'll show, and this is kind of, you know, following on what I just said. This is page five of the detailed memo. This financial plan shows the most recent financial plan included in the 2020 to adopted budget book.",budget
"So, these are the numbers that you'll see looking in the appendix references from the chair. And it shows how things have changed, and we'll go into those takeaways in some further comments. But I just want to point out some important consideration when looking at some of these numbers, because I'll reference points in this table, and there's a reason why I'm referencing those.",budget
"And first is, I believe the chair mentioned, our budget process. So, RCW 3532A requires that the city adopt a budget for the next fiscal year that balances available resources with adopted and appropriated expenditures. And so, that's the state law.",budget
"So, that requires that at the end of the projection, or the budget adopted for 2023, will balance to the bottom number in the table, will basically make the bottom number in 2023 essentially zero. So, the unreferred reserve fund balance. That is the state legal requirement.",budget
"So, I just want to focus now. So, again, as I mentioned, we're going to focus and key in on the really most important numbers on these tables. And this is a key one, which is the projected operating gap based on the adopted budget and the assumptions that are applied in the plan at this time.",budget
"And this will be a familiar number. Right now, there is approximately a 100, well, at the time of the budget adoption, there was approximately $146 million projected gap in 2023, and a similar number projected for 2024. So, meaning, once again, that the projected revenues were $146 million less than the projected expenditures in each of those years.",budget
"And then drawing from the starting balance, accounting for that gap in each one of those years means that the ending fund balance would have been projected to be $144 million negative in 2023, growing to negative 290 million in 2024. And again, those are the numbers that the budget would be expected to balance to, and that should be probably a familiar number at an earlier stage in the year in terms of the financial situation for the general fund, looking at the next budget cycle. And largely, the reason why this gap exists is a combination of three factors.",budget
"And so now I'll go to the third table, so the third financial plan. Actually, I'll talk about some of the changes because it's important, because the numbers, as you'll see, have shifted in a good direction, and there's a number of reasons for that. So really, I'm focusing on what happened in the 2021.",budget
"So originally, there was a projection about what 2021 would look like. Finance and the Department of Finance and Administrative Services staff and city budget office staff have done the work to assess how much is left over from 2021, so how expenditures compared to estimates, how revenues compared to estimates, and how much money is carried forward in the future years, and reassessed what resources kind of increased the fund balance starting for 2022. So as heard by the Finance and Housing Committee in its April 20th presentation, actual revenues to the general fund came in $33.5 million above revised estimates, so that's a good thing.",budget
"That adds one-time resources available for 2022. An even larger number, $231 million of difference between budgeted expenditures and actuals, so this means the city spent $231 million less than was projected in 2021. Now, there are a number of reasons for that, and part of it is that prior obligations, commitments that are either legal or contractual in nature or Council priorities were not fully completed in 2021, though the intent is to complete those.",budget
"And so these will be covered in an upcoming Council Bill, Council Bill 120316, which will actually be with the Finance and Housing Committee at the next meeting on May 17th. We'll detail this information for you, but for the purposes of the plan, what we have done is said a portion of the money that is available at the end of 2021 is going to be carried over into 2022, and there's a few different types of carry-forwards, automatic ones that have like specifically prior approval by Council to carry in the future years, and then legislative ones, which are ones that are part of that bill I referenced that will be submitted as a request to carry forward. And then there's some additional grant revenue that is anticipated that it offsets a portion of that money, but at the end of the day, $144 million of that money nets out the money, the resources that would transfer from 2021 to 2022.",budget
"But the good news is there's still a positive gain in the starting fund balance of $120 million based on 2021 financial results. In the next slide, I believe I will cover how some portion of that, thank you, will be used or is proposed to be used to replenish the City's Revenue Stabilization Fund. So, just a quick recap on the Revenue Stabilization Fund.",budget
"Prior to the start, so essentially in the 2020 process, there was about $127 million that fully funded both of those reserves. However, given the uses, the adopted budget included some paybacks. So, it was in recognition of that, the need for using those reserves no longer existed, and now the City could begin the process of replenishing those reserves to their policy levels.",budget
"The adopted plan, so the adopted financial plan for 2022 included basically the assumptions that are included in the 2022 adopted budget. So, the Resolution 32024 temporarily or permanently changed the Emergency Fund replenishment. Prior to that change, it would have been anticipated that the City would have fully replenished the Emergency Fund, which was on the order of $60 million, to its original levels after the use.",budget
"The change through that Resolution 32024 instead put in place a five-year replenishment timeline. It did not specifically imply what the timing of the amounts were for each particular year. However, the financial plan in the adopted budget reasonably included $10 million per year, which continues the amount that's in the 2022 adopted budget into future years.",budget
"So, there would be in the adopted financial plan a total of $40 million added back to the Emergency Fund. Revenue Stabilization Fund has a different policy. It's based on annual projected revenue collections.",budget
"However, the adopted budget included an amount of $15.4 million, which was actually higher than what was strictly required by the policy. However, it was the Council's decision to put more in the Revenue Stabilization Fund than was strictly required. The adopted budget financial plan continued that assumption, $15.4 million per year, which would have put $61.2 million into the Revenue Stabilization Fund through 2025.",budget
"The memo on page six talks about how these planned contributions would have replenished each of these fiscal reserves back to their policy levels, as stated in the fiscal policy. The Emergency Fund would have been on the order of 93% of what its policy level would have been by 2025, and the Revenue Stabilization Fund would have been at 97% based on this plan replenishment. Okay, with that, things have changed.",budget
"A key and notable change is that given the level of resources available at the end of 2021, there is in the existing fiscal policy for the Revenue Stabilization Fund a requirement that 50% of unreserved balances at year-end be deposited to the Revenue Stabilization Fund, which based on calculations from CBO, would be about $55.7 million. There's different layers of good news in the presentation, but by way of really good news, this deposit would fully replenish the Revenue Stabilization Fund in 2022, so essentially many years ahead of the plan. Then at that time, future contributions to the Revenue Stabilization Fund would be solely based on the percentage, which I think is half a percent of tax revenues in each projected year to be deposited to the Revenue Stabilization Fund to kind of keep up with growth in revenues.",budget
"That actual change in the fiscal policy requires an appropriation from the City Council, so we made the assumption in the revised plan that we'll share with you shortly that that decision, which we anticipate will be part of the mid-year supplemental, which we have not yet received but plan to receive in the coming months, would include a transfer of that amount of money to the Revenue Stabilization Fund to fully replenish it according to the fiscal policy. So this is more in the vein of projection changes, so changes in assumptions for the future. This specifically is inflation, so if you will hearken back to the presentation from CBO and the IRF about the revenue forecast update at April 20th, there was also mention of the significant impacts that cost increases through inflation have had and are projected to have on city expenditure lines.",budget
"So this information, which draws and is more detailed on pages 10 and 11 of the memo, show how those inflation expectations have changed in the financial plan. So these are coming from the Forecast Office and they've updated what their numbers are and these show that in 2023 and 2024 there are 0.8% and 1.3% higher inflation in each of those years than was anticipated when the adopted budget financial plan was generated. So that's fairly moderate but still an increase in the inflation assumption in those years.",budget
"What's more acute is that, as you read in the press and see in the numbers, is that inflation is really much higher in the current year, so right now, than it was originally anticipated to be. The table at the lower part of the slide shows that the inflation expectation at the time of the adopted budget was on the order of 3.2%. The April forecast numbers suggested that inflation is in fact closer to 7%, which is a 3.8% increase.",budget
"So for the purposes of building that into the plan to allow for the fact that costs are higher, that 3.8% has actually been added to the 2023 projection. The 2022 number is a current adopted budget number with some specific legislative revisions included, so I didn't feel comfortable adding it to 2022 to inflate what the 2022 expectation in this plan would be, though that number, if the cost increases are higher, there could certainly be a supplemental change that's requested. I mean, it's entirely possible.",budget
"For the purposes of the planning projections that we're discussing today, that higher inflation has been built into 2023. And to go a bit into the weeds about inflation, it largely affects labor costs, IT costs, facilities and fleet costs in the model and just in the economy in general. Those are the areas where we're buying services from external providers, and so we're kind of at the whims of how those cost increases are funneling through the economy.",budget
"And also to point out that the inflation is not an equivalent adjustment to both the revenues and expenditures in the model. It's something that underlies and permeates through projections of both, but it is not just as easy as saying, you know, we add 1.3, for example, in 2024 to both lines, to both revenues and expenditures. It's more complicated than that.",budget
"And if you think about revenues, just looking at something like sales taxes, there are some goods and services in the economy that are not subject to the sales tax, like gas, gasoline and food. And if the costs are going up on those items, that leaves less discretionary income for people to buy those items that would be subject to the tax. So just even, I mean, there's certainly many more examples of how inflation differs and impacts the economy in different ways, though in general, it's not viewed as a positive given the high levels that are forecasted for 2022.",budget
Thank you. I would just add in here. So what Tom is going over are some of the assumptions and information that informs the development of the financial plan.,budget
"I also just want to point back to comments that I think both Director Dingley, Chair Mosqueda and Tom have made about the dynamic nature of these numbers and that CBO is right now in the process of looking at baseline expenditures and what the projected increases may be due to inflation and other operational needs. So I just want to say again, as we're about to show the revised financial plan is that this is a point in time, we may be underestimating the growth in baseline expenditures in the financial plan. Tom did include some adjustments to try to account for some of that anticipated growth, but because CBO is in the middle of that process, we don't yet know what the actuals will be.",budget
"In addition to inflation costs, there are a number of pressures and we can get into this on the next slide too, but there are a number of pressures on expenditures, not the least of which, of course, inflation, but also disruption to supply chain, impact to the economy, and so on. Impact of the war in Ukraine, delays due to the concrete strike, a very tight labor market, all that put pressure on the costs that the city bears and change the timing of the outlays, and et cetera. So we'll get into more on the following slide, but just wanted to put that out there as well.",budget
"Thank you so much. And I'm going to read from page 10 here because I think it underscores all of those points. Other considerations outside of inflation, this is midway on page 10, second paragraph, include but not limited to employment and population trends, wage growth, business sector composition, and consumer preferences that will impact revenue growth and each will be differently impacted by inflationary forces.",budget
"That's true on the city expenditure side, and then that is also true for like our spending, and it's also true for what we are trying to deliver to the city as well. I'm trying to emphasize your point, Director Dingley, that this is going to have maybe a compounding effect once we see what inflation is as a standalone and then how these other factors come on board. Any additional comments or questions on that before we move to the big sort of forward-looking slides?",budget
"All right. Just to conclude and thank you all for the added comments because the key point is that this is a projection and it's the best available data and it will certainly change as we look at these numbers in the future. Let's look at how this, at least based on these assumptions, how the numbers have changed.",budget
"This is the most recent work that has been done in collaboration with CBO about looking at how the projections have changed given a number of the factors that I discussed in the previous slide, both the added benefit of higher fund balance in the 2022 revised projections. So if you look in the 2022 revised column, you see now that the adopted budget thought or projected we'd have $8 million of balance and now given the positive financial results, there's $273 million of starting balances. And then also the revenue forecast update has added, the received in April has added about $35 million of resources per year to the projection.",budget
"Also the planned or the potential change in how the reserves are replenished given the amount available to replenish the revenue stabilization fund reduces the planned transfer amount in future years. But really to just focus on, if we could, on the bottom line numbers, the key numbers of this table is to focus on the operating gap now. And so the 22 number I'll just say right off the bat is including the decisions I discussed previously, which are the potential decisions, which is essentially the legislative carry forwards and the replenishment of the fiscal reserves.",budget
"And that uses the large portion or all, you know, it's all funded from starting balance. So it's just, it's kind of shows up as a deficit in the table, but there is, I assure you, not a deficit in the 22 budget plan. However, for 2023 and beyond, these are all projections based on on the kind of non-one-time, but more of the ongoing items.",budget
"And again, a sliver of good news is that the operating gap has, based on these projections, declined to $117 million in 2023 and $107 million in 2024. And then further, the ending fund balance at the end of 2023, which is the legally adopted budget year, that ending fund balance projection is now declining to $35 million. And at the end of 2024, which is the, would be in the endorsed year, it's declined.",budget
"It's basically gone down by more than half. So it went from $290 million negative in the adopted financial plan to $142 million negative in this revised plan. And again, this is based on, this is based on a whole layered set of assumptions that we're making, which are certain to change, both with new revenue forecast information and updates through the baseline process that Director Dingley discussed.",budget
"I just wanted to point out, so it is modestly good news to see the projected number in 2023, sort of the ending fund balance, a negative $35 million versus closer to $150 million. But I just want to highlight that this is relying on one-time funds to support base city services, ongoing expenditures. It is also assuming that in 2023 and beyond, that there is no new spending.",budget
"So any of the sort of one-time expenditures that are regularly included in the proposed and adopted budgets, as well as any new or expanded programs or services could not be accommodated or not assumed to be accommodated in the expenditures in 2023 and beyond. So I just wanted to highlight that point as it restricts sort of options available to the city in terms of resources available to address issues in the community. Great.",budget
"It also doesn't assume any room for unexpected needs. So think that IT project that for whatever reason is running over time, not to pick on IT, or some judgment and claims item that comes sort of out of the blue. Those are not accounted for here either.",budget
"And so there's no buffer here to absorb those unexpected in addition to those new items. Thank you. And I'll just add, it assumes the same level of spending on certain items that we perceive to be ongoing.",budget
"So perhaps there's a conversation to be had there. And it also, as you can tell, does not yet assume additional revenue streams. So that is for conversation.",budget
"But just want to make sure that folks understand the base that's being shown there is existing expenditures without any additional new revenue, and both of which I think will have more conversation about. Director Panucci, before I go to Council Member Nelson, is there anything carrying over with the hand? Okay, great.",budget
"Can you highlight the revenues line, please? That's fine. Sorry, sorry.",budget
"I don't have a highlight on that row. But that's fine, just like it is. So on April 20, the revised 2022 revenues were $1,671,000,000.",budget
"And now here, it is $1,708,000,000, which is the revised 2022 revenue, which doesn't, it's not a lot compared with all the zeros, but that looks like about $30,000,000. So did something happen in the past couple of weeks? And can we, first, let me, I shouldn't, it's not prefacing.",budget
"I really do appreciate Chair Muscat of this approach, the planning approach. But as we continue, can we just expect that the projected revenues for 2022 will keep changing as we go forward? So I'll make a quick comment and then ask for Tom to provide clarification on the number.",budget
"Throughout 2020 and 2021, my effort has been to move to making sure that both the executive and the legislative branch got real-time information on any revenue projections at the same moment, so that we collectively were seeing information together, just like they do in the state just like they do in the state legislature with the leap forecast and projections there. And that is still my commitment. The first time I saw the revenue projections for April was at the same time that they were transmitted and posted on the economic revenue forecast website.",budget
"And the latter information came to us collectively from CBO's office. So in terms of what council can expect from us, you can expect us to get quarterly updates that will be presented in the same months of the economic and revenue forecast, followed by a presentation in our committee from the city budget's office to round out the revenue projections. Just want to make sure that we're still on the same page and still on the same plan for having that shared information.",budget
"So thank you for the question, Council Member Nelson. That is actually an amount that it's actually footnoted on the table. And this is an additional $37 million of grants.",budget
"So these are grants associated with decisions made in prior years. So basically, we're carrying forward an expenditure assumption. And there's, in some cases, an additional grant revenue that we have not received, but we expect to receive.",budget
"So the April 20th forecast update did not include that $37 million of grant, but it is money that we expect to receive. So for the purposes of this financial plan, we've added it. And we're actually working with the budget office and the forecast office to enhance how the budget monitoring of revenues is done so that this type of thing gets built into the forecast so that there's a one-to-one comparison between the two.",budget
"But keen eye on that number and the discrepancy. Any additional comments or questions on this? Okay, let's continue.",budget
"So looking at these these projected gaps and changes in the ending fund balance in the future, there are just a kind of a few just kind of thought experiments that we have gone through to how a council could think about these strategies to address these deficits or gaps. There are probably more that we have not thought of, but the ones we've included for today are reducing or right-sizing the general fund budgets to match expenditures. Or also, and this is kind of more as a sensitivity analysis, the forecast council endorsed the forecast office director's recommendation to use the baseline revenue forecast for the current projections.",budget
"But there are other scenarios that are available based on the national data that we use for modeling that are both optimistic and pessimistic. So we've shown how using those two looks at what the future could hold, how that impacts these numbers. And then also there is ways that restricted fund policies could be changed.",budget
"So to change how much the general fund is sending to other funds, or looking the other way, how much other restricted funds could send to the general fund. So we model these as both longer-term and shorter-term approaches, given that if we could actually look back, Interim Director Panucci at the table, a key point of this. So again, if we look at the operating gap row, and this is kind of the... I mentioned not only the challenges, but also the opportunities.",budget
"If you look at the gap, it's $117 million in 2023, but it actually decreases to $69 million in 25 and $37 million in 36. And one thought that I've had about that is that there are some revenues in the general fund projection that have recovered to the pre-pandemic projections that are in fact exceeding what we would have expected them to be. However, there are other categories that are still lagging behind.",budget
"And I think this trend shows that as those other categories recover more slowly, they start to impact the general fund financial plan and mean that the gap in the future is smaller than the gap we're experiencing in the near term. So this kind of underlies the concept that there may be some shorter-term strategies that can bridge the gap with a smaller structural change and a small and then some targeted one-time approaches. Great.",budget
Council Member Herbold at the April 20th meeting raised a good question about how do we see inflation showing up in these expenditures? Like where are those pressures coming in? I think we've detailed some of that.,budget
"And so those add additional pressures, especially with the likes of inflation and other things coming in. And I also just wanted to highlight that what Tom has shown you so far is... This is why I came to all of you very early this year to start this conversation.",budget
"As it relates to the slide that identifies long-term and near-term sustainability strategies, the concept of temporary changes to restricted fund policies and use of fund balance, do we have sort of a catalog of all of the existing restricted fund policies that we could take a look at and see whether or not there are some that we do want to consider a temporary change and others that we don't? I'll take that, Tom. Thank you, Council Member Herbold.",budget
"I don't have readily a catalog, but we could look at all of the funds that we often refer to as sort of general fund adjacent, which is policies that the Council has the authority to modify and provide that to the committee. But it includes things like the point Tom brought up in terms of there is a policy around transferring funds to the Revenue Stabilization Fund. That is one example.",budget
"I'm really happy that, Chair Mosqueda, you've asked for this level of detail to be presented to us so early in the budgeting process. Anytime we can lift up an appendix and daylight it like this, I've got my I Love Spreadsheets mug ready to go here. I appreciate Budget Director Dingley mentioning the labor cost issue.",budget
"A lot of us are on the Labor Relations Policy Committee, so having these numbers now is really vital information for us to have in terms of where the gaps are. I just wanted to say we worked really hard on the 2022 budget that we're in right now, and so I don't favor cutting things that we already promised to our constituents for this calendar year. I do support replenishing our Emergency Fund and Revenue Stabilization Fund based on our current policy, and it looks like that will be possible to do.",budget
"I recognize that there is still a gap of that $35 million at the end of the day for 2023 and then gaps in 2024 and 2025, so I really appreciate these strategies being put forward to consider options, and I'll mention an option that might not be popular with everybody, but wanted to get more information about that. When I look at the adopted 2022 budget document that was put online recently, there is in the appendix on page 783, it does talk about the payroll tax, the jumpstart tax that Council Member Muskane and others were champions of that tax, and thankfully that has helped us to deal with a gap last year, and it's coming in at higher than expected numbers, and in that appendix, page 783, it says for 2023 the jumpstart tax was projected at $250 million, and now it's projected about $296 million, and so I just wanted to see what it might look like with different strategies. We obviously all approve the investment plan for jumpstart.",budget
"Tom, I'm wondering if you could spend a little bit more time as well talking about the right sizing concept here. Obviously, I think the word choice is important, right sizing versus cuts, because we all want to make sure that we are avoiding austerity budgeting, especially given the data and the experience that I noted at the beginning of this meeting, which showed that jurisdictions who invested in core government services saw a faster rebound in economies that benefited both the public and private sector. I'm wondering, though, if you could talk a little bit about the analysis in the last few pages of your memo that talks about how you saw a three point, maybe it was 3.6 percent under use of spends, and how that right sizing could potentially be calculated.",budget
"And on page eight of the memo, there is the calculation that the Chair referenced, and this looks at 2021 actual results, which I discussed in the earlier slide, which resulted in revenues above budget and significant amounts of expenditures below budget. Of course, some of those are carry forwards. You can see the calculation on page eight, but the punch line is that even after accounting for carry forwards, general fund expenditure actuals in 2021 were 3.15 percent lower than what was budgeted, which was about 50 million dollars in the year.",budget
"And so, just by way of a thought experiment, and again, this is, you know, kind of taking a broad metric and applying it to the plan, the underlying process by which these numbers would result would require more targeted and surgical approach, looking at vacancies and the various ways in which those savings were generated. But if we assumed a 3 percent reduction in expenditures in each year of the plan, that would carve out about 50 million dollars per year from the projections, which would revise the gap to 67 million dollars in 23 and 56 million dollars in 24, which would then balance the unreserved ending fund balance for 2023. So, there would be a net 14 million dollars remaining.",budget
"However, the 2024 projection would still be 42 million dollars negative for the ending balance. Again, this is just a thought experiment, just that one approach, one piece of an approach that could be taken, and just showing how a 3 percent reduction would look. Additional clarification, Director Dingley?",budget
"So, job well done, Tom. As Tom noted, the base revised financial plan that he's sharing inflates IT, fleets, and facilities costs. It doesn't inflate necessarily all costs.",budget
"So, the number here on the expenditures is likely, based on what I've been seeing over the last month in reviewing department preliminary submittals for the budget, is likely under counting by about half on the expenditure side. So, instead of a 3 percent, what we've been seeing is needing to close a gap of around 6 percent in order to account for those increases in costs overall. Like, that is the unexpected hits, that is the just increase in, you know, supply chain impact, the, you know, sorry again, Director Loader, if you're listening, the over budget or over timeline IT project, those items that were unexpected that are coming in at much higher than anticipated.",budget
"And so, that's where I just want to caution over-reliance on those kind of one-time tools. So, if that didn't make any sense, you can feel free to ask me clarifying questions, but wanted to try to convey that that is, that it's a good one-time tool. It's not necessarily a great ongoing tool out accompanying changes and expectations of department performance and programs and services.",budget
"Okay, thank you. And I'm going to turn to Council Member Herbold to ask her question in just a second. I just want to make sure, though, that I understood as well an important point of, I think, the analysis in the memo in front of us, which is underspend for 2022 may help us for a 2023 budget, but it doesn't help us for the outgoing years.",budget
"And I think that to that point, what we're looking at when we talk about right-sizing is not having a budget that every year over-invests into positions where you see $100-plus million carrying over every year. I don't think that it's solid budgeting practice as well to have budgets pass year over year that are constantly at an elevated rate, where then you see an average amount being transferred into the second, or transferred back into the general fund because of chronic underspending. And so if there is a right-sizing of that initial investment in a budget, hopefully a biannual budget, not just a 12-year calendar budget, but when there's the right-sizing of a budget, then we know what the actual universe of dollars is for programs and services.",budget
"And I saw Tom come off of mute as well. I see your hand, Director Dingley, but I want to make sure that both are true, right? We don't want to have chronic use of underspend, and one potential way to get away from that is to look at right-sizing.",budget
"So this is a signal to me that we need to regroup and perhaps have the detailed technical conversation about using the feedback and iterative process, how to improve those future projections, perhaps in other categories that the current models that are used by both the executive and now that we have been discussing today include those more thorough inflationary projections. So that, again, the plan is useful. I see.",budget
"And I think what you're hearing me signal to you is that I am already seeing pressures, increased pressures on those costs. And so I want you to just have that in the back of your minds that it's not a finding $30 million and we're done, walk away kind of a situation. And so I don't want you to be caught surprised when I come back to you to say, actually, it's a bit more.",budget
"One other point I just wanted to make, Chair, you raised a really great point and I had meant to bring it up earlier, but in working with Glenn Lee's office, Director Lee's office, we're doing really exciting work about starting up enhanced monitoring, budget to actual monitoring throughout the city. So I share that frustration of having empty budget sitting around and not going out there to be used for the highest and best priority and best laid plans. There's a lot of circumstance that can happen in a department.",budget
"My question was originally around payroll tax surplus above projected, but I'm not going to go back to that since the time has come and gone for that topic. And I can ask my questions offline. I do want to just flag that I am struggling with, Madam Chair, your distinction of a cuts budget and not wanting to do austerity budgeting from this exercise, which it has an expenditure reduction.",budget
"It sounds like we're trying to make some sort of a distinction here that an expenditure reduction is somehow different than a cut. And I think what I hear you saying is that the expenditure reduction is attempting to maybe not model, but sort of spitball what the underspend is for departments. And I hear Director Dingley saying that that may not be a solution that carries forward sort of the sustainability that we're seeking for future budgets in this ongoing planning exercise that hopefully is going to become routine.",budget
"And so on the operating side, it sounds to me like what we should be looking at is whether or not we can assume some sort of underspend rate for departments based on past practices or past real-time or past analysis of prior years, because that's basically how they set the SPU. They looked at prior years and said, well, how many of these dollars are we actually delivering year after year after year? And they set their completion rate based on those actual past practices.",budget
"And I'm just wondering if we looked at past years operating budgets underspends in transferring over to future years, whether or not we could come to some similar conclusions upon which to base future budgeting. Thank you very much, Vice Chair. And yeah, I think that's exactly my desire as well.",budget
"I think, and I'll turn to Directors Panucci and Dingley here in just a second, but as part of the analysis from the central staff memo, if we're routinely seeing a certain percentage across departments be carried over into the next year, is there a routine underspend analysis that we can, or is there a routine underspend, and is there an analysis that we can help extrapolate to saying perhaps there is a way to look at higher than needed amounts going into each budget year over year? I hear both the caution to say, you know, that may solve for a near-term issue for the next budgeting cycle, but maybe even if we look at doing that year over year, the dollar amounts from past analyses might not help us as much with future analyses, given some of those unknowns that have been described. But that's exactly what I would like to do, and then try to apply some sort of forecast to what we can potentially anticipate.",budget
"And so I'm going to add to my list of takeaways here, in addition to the Catalog of General Fund Adjacent Revenue that we can look at, looking at a year over year analysis of the underspend for past practices, so we can try to extrapolate some way to apply that if we were to go to a right-sizing option as well in the future, still recognizing the caveat of additional increase in cost overall. Director Panucci, then Director Dingley, and then we'll see if there's any additional questions. Thank you.",budget
"You more or less made my point, which was going to be that we are interested in talking with CBO and the forecast office to do a longer look back at the historic variance in these projections, but also we'll just note, as what Director Dingley highlighted, which it would help us one time, the more efficient or closer to actuals that budgets are adopted, the less sort of opportunity there is, especially when your central staff is looking for ways to find one-time strategies to support council budget proposals during the budget process. It just sort of squeezes that out, so the better we get at projecting annual expenditures, that will just be like a one-time option, which is a worthy exercise, and I'm looking forward to partnering more with Julie as they move into their deeper, their work on enhancing their oversight of actuals, but just noting, just sort of highlighting that we are working on that exercise and look forward to reporting to you all on that in the future. Great.",budget
"Occasionally, we have built-in overall general fund underspend targets, just looking at past practice. I don't believe we have one in the 22 adopted budget, but I know that we have done that in the past, so absolutely, it's a tool at our disposal. I wanted to highlight that the slide Tom previously had up of all of the different options, and apologize, Tom, that we're still on option one here of things to explore, but the answer lies in a combination of these things, right?",budget
"No one of these items is sort of the salvation overall, and there's no path to, that's too many double negatives, in order to avoid an austerity budget, we're going to have to employ all of these tools, and there's no path to balancing that relies on only one tool, and so I just want to flag that for you as well. Well, that might be a good segue because, Tom, I don't see a fourth bullet on this slide, and I think another important one is revenue. We talked a lot about looking at existing revenue streams, but I think that there is still the situation, even with the passage of Jumpstart, that we are in a very regressive tax state, and looking at potential progressive options as a longer-term solution is going to be important, and I really appreciate that Council Member Peterson, in asking for the catalog of options, also noted any use of revenue, general fund adjacent revenue would need to be short-term in nature and potential temporary solutions, so I look forward to filling out our presentation here a little bit more.",budget
"I know we're already over time, and I see two hands, so I want to make sure that we get a chance to go through the last slides here. Director Panucci, did you have additional context to add? Yeah, just quickly, because I was going to note your point as well, is that not explicitly stated on this slide is assumptions about new sources of revenue, but you could look at any of these options and assume that if there was a new source of revenue, that in the amount shown, like instead of a three percent expenditure reduction, if it was a three percent, you know, that amount of money was increased in the revenue, it would also help balance, so I think you should be thinking of these options as, you know, a improvement, like the optimistic forecast would show what would happen if there was an improvement in the economic condition, or if we had a new line of a source of funds to support the general fund to increase revenues accordingly, so to your point, Council Member Mosqueda, you can think of any of these options as also being a presentation of what would be assumed if there was additional revenues, except for the pessimistic forecast.",budget
"If we're looking for a policy direction here, I don't know, I wasn't here when the panel of experts talked about the benefits of progressive spending over austerity spending, and the difference, I mean, the semantic difference between right-sizing and austerity, some of the nuances lost on me, but basically right-sizing, part of the memo here, is right-sizing general fund budgets to better align actual expenditures with appropriations and or reductions in services. That sounds reasonable to me, what I think that we should be doing. I appreciate the option of using alternative revenue forecast assumptions, which Director Panucci just touched on.",budget
"Yes, we should always be considering alternatives to the knowledge that we have in a point of time. I will note that the central staff memo does, when comparing optimistic forecast assumptions versus pessimistic assumptions, the probability of these optimistic is 15 percent. Probability of coming true compared to the pessimistic scenario probability is 35 percent.",budget
"I think that gets to that brown line that was basically indicating what's going on with the war. Anyway, the point is that it seems as though we have a duty every year to make sure that our assumptions on what we'll have to spend the following year are as correct as possible, and then just proceed forward. I'm not really, I don't understand this, we can, I always thought that the operating directive from CBO was assumed six percent potential reduction.",budget
"Now this says three, so maybe offline I can get a better sense of the difference in those numbers, but just wanted to lay all this out before we continue, since it seems that that will definitely impact whether or not we do consider additional revenue sources going forward. Thanks. Director Dingley, very quickly, and then let's try to round out the discussion here.",budget
"Of course, thank you, and thank you Councilmember Nelson for that question. Two things. One, we developed the target reductions before the April revenue forecast came out, so we did actually really good guessing and good modeling, because as I mentioned, what we're seeing in terms of additional costs that are mandatory that we have to find funding to cover is more in the six percent realm.",budget
"Thank you, Madam Chair. So again, continuing the analysis of different, you know, possibilities, and building off of Councilmember Nelson's comments about the different forecasts. Indeed, these projections are using the baseline forecast, though there are other lower probability scenarios that could come to pass based on the imperfect information.",budget
"We just went ahead by way of sensitivity of the projections and included scenarios that include the different options. First one we're looking at here on this slide is what if we were using the optimistic forecast, which is the 15 percent probability compared to 50 percent for the baseline, what would happen? So that would bring the projected operating gap down to $82 million in 23 and $71 million in 24.",budget
"It would actually, by 2026, it would be nearly zero. The 2023 ending balance would be a positive $14 million, so that would be balanced by state law, and the 2024 projected for the endorsed budget would be still a negative $57 million. And again, this is not a recommendation, not an endorsement.",budget
"The Forecast Council has endorsed and spoken with regards to the baseline forecast, so that is what we are sticking with for the purposes of the projection. But that's the kind of the bright, you know, the bright side scenario. The other, you know, in giving due consideration of alternatives, the more dour, pessimistic scenario, which is actually a 35 percent probability, and that's sort of in line with if you, you know, read the financial and economic literature and news as much as I do, generally consistent with what economists are predicting for a chance of a recession, would greatly impact negatively the operating gap, bringing the projection down to, in fact, a higher gap in the current year by $31 million more of less revenue, though it's not, again, not a gap per se, but just wanted to point that out because there would be current year impacts.",budget
"But moreover, looking at the future budget, it would be a $173 million gap in 23 and a $192 million gap in 24. And again, this is just a scenario, not the most likely one. But in looking at these numbers and kind of building off of the, you know, this is still a work in progress commentary from Director Dingley, the revenue situation is also a similar work in progress.",budget
"This, the April numbers that were presented to this committee in April on the 20th of last month, were the first of six looks at revenue and reasonably expected to have the largest variances in terms of making uncertain projections. So just pointing that out, there will be two additional looks this year that will form the reality about how much revenue there is to spend in the next few years. And that will be used for purposes of balancing the budget.",budget
"So, you know, it could trend either way. But I just wanted to point that out, that we are still in the early innings with regards to the revenue forecast for next year's budget. And then if we could move to, if there aren't any questions about that, move to the next slide.",budget
"And this is building from an earlier comment I made about how the projected deficit, and you can see in the top line of this table, is actually smaller in the future than it is in the more near term, given, you know, a projection of faster, more rapidly recovering revenues later on in the year. So not next year per se, but in the future. So just again, just by way of modeling different ways and kind of building off the myriad of approaches, comment from Director Binggeli, this is a way of saying doing a $70 million long-term measure, whatever that may be, revenue or expenditure, and then balancing the higher gap in the near term with temporary measures.",budget
"And for just the purposes of this analysis, looked at the 2025 projection, because that's the, it's the, you know, when the deficit starts to decrease, and then said what, and then basically imputed how much short-term support would be necessary to balance things out. So as you can see, the revised balance is actually a positive $82 million at the end of 23, and grows to $93 million at the end of 24. So that's actually, you know, that's significant extra one-time resource using this type of approach.",budget
"So it kind of triggered the thought of, well, what if we instead model an approach that relied on this balance going into 23, and sort of mitigated and delayed the need for a longer-term measure. And so that's how this looks. We added a long-term measure.",budget
"So again, this is the concept of a revenue option, perhaps, that takes some time to ramp up, that doesn't start until 2024, of $65 million, just for the purposes of make the numbers work. And then plugging in the same temporary measures, $48 million per year, again, brings the ending balance to a positive number. So this approach uses a combination of fund balance, ongoing structural measures, which could be revenue or expenditure in nature, in the second year, and temporary measures in 23 and 24, to again, make the numbers all balance out based on these projections, which of course are in development and will change in the next book.",budget
"Yes, in terms of the adopted budget, but also how do we begin preparing for 2023 and beyond? And looking at the financial health of the city's budget for the next six years is something that I know after today, we are all committed to. Additional comments, and I saw Director Panucci, you came off mute.",budget
"So in sort of final comments and next steps here, and Tom, you're welcome to keep that last slide up if you'd like, or Allie, we again will have the six-year financial plan presented to the Finance and Housing Committee meeting in August after we receive additional information from the Revenue Forecast Office and from the City Budgets Office in the August presentations. We anticipate at the end of September, as per usual, the Mayor's proposed budget will be coming down. We are coming back to a biennial budget of sorts.",budget
"So 2023 adopted, and excuse me, 2023 adopted, 2024 endorsed, and this will hopefully be one of the last times we do a semi-biennial budget because we're all really looking forward to biennial budgeting. And then again, colleagues, I think that there will be many more conversations that all of us will be having about ways to address these issues leading into August, and if not before. Again, thanks to the Executive Team for pulling together the Revenue Task Force.",budget
The five-year plan has to be adopted at both the implementation board and governing committee level. So looking at my two governing committee members here and just flagging that you will see this multiple times and have a lot of opportunity to provide your feedback in terms of the priorities of the authority. Thinking about the budget specifically in relationship to this.,budget
"Like, this timeline is likely to stay pretty similar in years forward, and so by moving to this six-year budget in alignment with the five-year plan, we then at least have—six years for biennial, by the way—we then have the ability to ease into the budget planning with much less of a, oh gosh, what's happening, how can we pull this material together and get the right people to look at it, in-time attitude or vibe. So the projected budgets that will come with that plan in September will take us through 2028. I'll just pause there briefly if there are any questions before I move to the next section of this report out.",budget
"So that's $400,000 of the $2.4 million now. So at least some portion to comply with the legislative intent would have that. It's not a proviso.",budget
"Good. I'll also just add, I mean, since we're in the project space, we are at about 70. This has probably changed since I last ran the numbers, which was Monday.",budget
"On Monday, we were 75% contracts implemented. It's probably gone up since then. You know, I will note a couple things.",budget
"Final report is forthcoming with an evaluation of the overall impacts of this new budget model. A Challenge of this new model was transitioning from staff used to holding on to their site revenues to an understanding how this redistribution of resources supports equitable programs or, excuse me, supports equitable access to programs to more people. Next Slide, please. So",budget
"There's just no doubt about it. It would hurt small business. And right now, we don't need that.",budget
"Um, just want to clarify, uh, for my colleagues in the viewing public, the first quarter response is, um, not all we had hoped for for the first quarter, but I do think it's important to hear from the executive on its plans, uh, moving forward and to hear from them, their continued support, uh, for this, for this work. Secondly, um, we'll have on the agenda resolution 32 Oh five zero sponsored by council member Nelson. I do have a proposed amendment to this resolution, uh, and the amendment, um, just clarifies that the resolution is to, um, signal our intent to consider release of funds in an amount necessary to implement incentive and retention programs, acknowledging that some of the salary savings, um, using some of the salary savings is a strategy to help mitigate the gap.",budget
"And as we refer to the sort of projected, um, 2023 budget challenges that the Council has been discussing at last week's Finance and Housing Committee, this, the makeup of the Finance Committee is the same as this, um, Committee. So, you were all briefed on, on where we stand there. So, I won't say more about that now, but happy to answer questions.",budget
"I do care about the impact on our overall budget, and I do care about how spending in one category affects spending in any other category in our city budget. That's our responsibility as budget members, um, members of the Finance Committee, and all of us heard that, uh, the gap that we are currently facing, while it has shrunk from approximately $148 million to about $35 million, thanks in large part to, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the to about $35 million, thanks in large part to our central staff's deep dive analysis, thanks to Tom Mikesall and Ali Panucci for working in collaboration with Julie Dingley, our Director of the City Budget's Office. We still have a multi-million dollar gap for the 2023-2024 budget years and the out years.",budget
"Uh, in large part, that gap was filled with jumpstart funds that helped to make sure that we were not in the red in 2020 and 2021 and 2022. However, um, we are very much needing to make sure that we close that gap. As you heard the Director from the City Budget's Office say in our Finance and Committee meeting last week, we have now apparently asked our departments to hold, uh, back funding for 2022 spending, which is spending priorities of the Mayor's Office and City Council members, including things like hygiene centers, bathrooms for folks who need to use it, um, as tourists or folks who are lived to their house and those unhoused.",budget
"So I do appreciate that your amendment helps to scope what that amount would be within that existing funds that currently have the proviso on it. And again, I think the concern, while it is a larger amount that's currently being held in the proviso than we originally thought it might be, the gap that we have to deal with at the end of the year for not just 2023, but the out years as well is significantly higher than anyone had known before. Thanks in large part.",budget
"Now we know this because of Tom Meisel and Ali Panucci's good work. We have a six-year financial plan, but the hundreds of millions of dollars that are in the out years as a potential gap is what has given me great pause here. So thank you for helping to clarify though what the lifting of the proviso effect actually is.",budget
I don't specify that everything should be spent. I identify those salary savings as a source of funding. And I appreciate you nuancing Council Member Mosqueda's portrayal of what this does.,budget
"Colleagues, I am not going to be able to support this resolution in front of us today. I already outlined the budget structural issues that we're facing. I think again, this is a critical moment for us to look at every dollar and we've made some very tough decisions as a collective city family already in 2022 on very important 2022 priorities.",budget
"We've asked folks to put a pause on a number of investments that I know all of us are deeply troubled by. And so as we do that, we can't on the other hand, be then freeing up additional dollars that could help us at the end of this year to address the structural budget issue that I believe is going to create greater ramifications for 2023 and 2024. This is also about making sure that we have investments in things that the human resources department within our city has identified as ways to improve not just retention, but recruitment.",budget
"I was listening to the presentation last week. From 2010 to 2022, general fund revenues grew by 86% and general fund spending grew by 97%. We are approaching the level of revenues that are greater than pre-pandemic levels.",budget
"So, there are decisions that have been made by this city council that have led to the difficult conversations that we will be making next year regarding the budget. But you already had one of those difficult conversations last year when you approved funding for 125 officers this year. And so, again, this act, this resolution does not contemplate taking money away from other priorities.",budget
"In fact, it is simply leaving the money there for its intended use. And I don't want to belabor this point anymore and just move on. But I listened to the public comments too.",budget
"Again, my argument is still that we still have huge needs at the end of this year that we'll need to account for for our upcoming biannual budget. But I do want to ask a question about the other departments. And I understand from the discussion that we all had in the Finance and Housing Committee meeting last week, that the City Budget Office is currently trying to do a much more thorough job of real time budgeting, having accountability reports from the department.",budget
"So we know in real time if there's underspend. However, we know what the underspend is currently at SPD. Do we know what the universe of underspend dollars is for the other departments and how much this may cost in total?",budget
"Thank you, Chair Mosqueda. We don't have that information currently available. It is something we have been in ongoing discussions with CBO and they are working on that.",budget
"I think there are a couple of dynamics working here. As a general strategy, we are looking at underspend to help mitigate the projected shortfall in 2023 and perhaps beyond. How that works in practice is somewhat complicated for the other departments where we're not able to track in such fine detail the real time salary savings.",budget
"There are a couple of things. There are a number of specific spending proposals that were included in the adopted budget that are currently on hold pending better news forecasted for 2023. So those are not necessarily salary savings, but specific spending adopted in the 2022 budget that are currently on hold.",budget
"And I think you or Chair Herbold mentioned a couple of them in the discussion on the resolution. And then in addition, the budget office is looking for underspend across departments that might help mitigate that. They're not currently restricted by proviso.",budget
"I did not say that there was a decrease in the amount in the proviso. I was agreeing with the Chair, Madam Chair, that there was an increase in the amount of underspend anticipated. I'm sorry for not catching that myself, but that is your description.",budget
"So I'm suggesting that as part of our way to address public safety issues, we hold these conversations for later in the year to really make sure that we're having a conversation about where we would like any underspend to go in future budgets when we look at the universe of dollars available and the universe of needs at the end of this year. According to the central staff memo that is in front of us on this legislation, central staff noted this may impact future budget decisions before council. In addition, salary savings are considered one-time resource.",budget
"And so that is what I was elected to do was represent their needs. And I don't think that even if we were to authorize the full $4.5 million and it were spent in 2022, which is not really a possibility, that's a drop in the bucket of a $117 million projected budget gap in 2023. And there are other places to make necessary cuts to balance our budget.",budget
I wouldn't call that right sizing. I would call that our job to budget for what we can afford. But public safety is not the place to make those cuts.,budget
"Much has been made about polling in the last few months, but I do want to direct us to the recent Elway poll conducted by Crosscut, where it said 92% of respondents said that if they could direct where tax dollars went, they would spend those tax dollars on helping folks with addiction issues and mental health support and services. I think that we have an opportunity going forward in our upcoming budget to do more of that and to really prioritize funding in that way. So that is one of the reasons, as I noted, that I'll be putting no on the underlying bills here today.",budget
"So this isn't something that we would be prepared at this moment to provide for the last three years. It was something that, that we would need to affirmatively start to track. And it would be.",budget
"The obligations. For payment of fees, maintenance obligations. During the time between resolution and approval.",budget
"Budgeting of course, for a governmental entity is very important. As is your treasury, your investments. I mentioned debt already.",budget
"We look at your operating expenses and your non-operating expenses and your equity, which is called for a governmental entity net position. Also this year you did have a 2021 and it will be true again in 2022. You do have a lot of bond activity.",budget
"We might post it, but it doesn't get posted until the following year just because it's small. But I here to tell you, we did not have any of those past adjustments. In fact, the only one that was recorded was one reclassification entry for the water fund, which just impacted a couple of accounts on the balance sheet.",budget
"So no impact at all to the operations of the water fund. We do obtain a representation letter from management every year that just really lists out their assumptions and their beliefs regarding a lot of the estimation that are in the financial statements, because of course, a lot of the numbers do come from estimates such as environmental liabilities or potential litigation allowance for doubtful accounts to the receivables or depreciation. And the only other unusual item that was in that letter this year, there was a new accounting standard that was required to be adopted this year related to interest costs on construction projects.",budget
It says that did not need it's Wimby. Their utilization. Talk a little bit more about that.,budget
Compared to previous years. I'm not. Just seeing that number in a vacuum doesn't kind of.,budget
"Yeah. Yeah. Again, I need to look at data that is from preceding years, but my recollection is we were hovering around 30%.",budget
"A, this legislation includes the 2022 portion of that. And Then our 2023 budget will include probably a similar amount for the 23 portion of that. That's It. Great.",budget
"Should be exceptional. So This is part of the process that we currently have, but I do look forward to our ongoing conversations in the Select Budget Committee meetings and in the Finance and Housing Committee meetings about how we can continue to create budgets that more accurately align with each of the Department's needs for the budget in front of them for the upcoming year. And Ideally, the upcoming biannual budgets as we move towards biannual budgeting as well. I",budget
Budget authority covers the operations from January 1st through December 31st of the year. The Budget discussion and document includes reference to a multiple year capital improvements program. The Actual budget adoption itself only adopts one year of capital investments for the upcoming budget year. And,budget
"That means that monies that are dedicated for capital project improvements automatically carry into future years until they are either fully spent or the City Council elects to abrogate or reduce those appropriations through the law. All Other appropriations absent any other measure are assumed to be non-lapsing. So That means when the fiscal year is complete at December 31st, the authority to spend that money goes away. The",budget
"Exceptions to that are grants. So In the event that the Council accepts money from external sources, so grant revenues is a key type, but there's also some service contract type revenues, there will be provision in the ordinance that spends that money that provides for a non-lapsing, so similar to the capital money, the ability for that money to be fully spent. And Largely that's due to the concept that grant monies are irregular in terms of receipt and they're tied to performing a specific attached to the reason why the grant money was provided in the first place. So",budget
"It doesn't always align specifically with the fiscal year, so the Council provides that non-lapsing authority. Also There are other cases where the Council may in ordinance provide what's termed more administrative authority and to some select appropriations within the budget. So Those are all done within the budget authority that provide within the budget legislation that provides those specific authorities. And",budget
"Then finally there's what we term encumbrance is. And So this is essentially an accounting term, which is providing, shifting the budget authority to complete contracts or agreements that the city has already entered into the prior year and just providing the authority to spend money from the city treasury when we receive those invoices, which can sometimes come after the year is complete. So That's really just tied at an accounting level where we just want to ensure that we have money to pay invoices when we receive them. So",budget
"By way of a kind of a high level perspective and there's a detail on this on page three of the memo, there's $1.9 million of automatic carry forward across all city funds. So In last year's analysis, approximately the same amount of money that was carried forward into the 2021 budget, which it was about 27% increase in the budget authority for the year. And So that's across all funds and it's automatically been adjusted into the revised budget. And",budget
You'll see a later table how that factors into the full context of the city budget. So If you look at the next slide. So That covers the automatic authority. The,budget
Next piece more salient to the discussion today is supplementals. And So state law provides four supplementals and I referenced in the memo kind of the specific wording because it's interesting to know. It Allows the council with a three-fourths majority to appropriate from the emergency fund or other designated funds an amount sufficient to meet the actual necessary expenditures of the city for which insufficient or nor appropriations have been made due to causes which could not have reasonably been enforcing at the time of making the budget. So,budget
"That is the provision in state law that allows for supplemental adjustments to take place. You Noted in the definition that there is a voting threshold that applies. So When there is an actual stated, specifically stated emergency, similar to the COVID emergency that's still in place, the voting threshold for supplemental adjustments to pay for things related to that emergency is two-thirds of the city council. Otherwise,",budget
"It's a three-quarters approval threshold. However, There is, in cases where there are grant monies that are being received in the legislation that are completely funding the supplemental increase to the budget, it's a simple majority vote. And So some of the legislation that has been approved so far this year has been subject to that simple majority because it has essentially accepted new grant revenue and spent that revenue. And",budget
"Finally, just in terms of the kind of the nature of the supplementals, there are what I term standalone or comprehensive. So Standalone bills kind of are single subject and more specific. The Grant acceptance ordinances, some of which have been already passed this year, are of that type. And",budget
"Would just add here that we have been working with the direction of Chair Miscada to really try to reduce the number of supplemental budget actions that the council has asked to take up during the year. The Number of budget changes throughout the year make it difficult for the, I think, for the public and the council to track what was approved and what is happening and how funds are being expended and outcomes and that sort of thing. And So just we'll highlight that we have moved from a quarterly supplemental process to what we're hoping to get even more clearly a twice-a-year process for the comprehensive bills, a mid-year supplemental, and a year-end supplemental budget bill that gets transmitted in September with the next year's proposed budget and hope over time to also streamline all of the individual grant acceptance ordinances into just those comprehensive mid-year packages, except when there are sort of emergent situations that require immediate action. And",budget
"So just a little bit more detail. Thank You for adding that, Ali. The Additional detail, and this is covered in page three through four of the memo, there have been four standalone supplemental bills passed by City Council thus far appropriating a total of $26.8 million. These",budget
"Include appropriations for the Seattle Rescue Plan Act 4 and accept a couple of acceptances of SPD grants, and finally SDOT grant acceptance. So That's the activity thus far. The Comprehensive bills are the carry forward, and then as Ali pointed out, the mid-year and year-end supplemental bills. And",budget
"Then finally, the exceptions, which is budget instances where department spending has exceeded the appropriation for the year, and there is a request to true that up after the fiscal year on an exceptional basis. This Ties it all together. As You can see, we started with a 2022 adopted budget of $7.1 million. You",budget
"Can see the general fund, other fund splits. There's $96.7 million of automatically carried forward money in the general fund, $1.8 million in other funds, bringing the total adjustment up to $1.9 billion. Standalone Bills, the four bills that I just mentioned, add another $26.8 million of budget authority, bringing the total revised budget to just shy of $9.1 billion, which is roughly a 27% increase to the adopted budget. So",budget
"Now with that kind of context about budget adjustments in general, I'll now dive into some of the specific details of the bills before you this morning. So Council Bill 120316, the carry forward legislation, would increase the city budget across all funds by $127.7 million. The Summary attachments submitted with the legislation shows the detail for all of these proposed changes as submitted by the executive. Central",budget
"Staff has reviewed those to determine whether or not they meet the character and nature of a carry forward, so essentially continuing work that was begun in 2021 that is anticipated to continue into 2022 and just needs the resources to shift across fiscal years to continue that work. What I've done in the memo in this presentation is just pulled out those most significant changes, those items that are of Council interest, to just kind of give it flavor and to kind of show the bulk of where the funds are going. And I would also point out that the memo, the appendix, so page nine of the staff memo, includes a very detailed table by department showing the information I've covered so far, so the adopted budget starting points, the auto carry forward adjustments, and then puts that revised budget in the context of this request. So",budget
You can see the percentage increases to each department budget because of this carry forward bill. And So these are the percents that I show on this slide. The OPCD budgets of the Office of Planning and Community Development would increase by 95% based on the appropriation change in this bill. The,budget
"A general fund increase to implement strategic investment fund allocations. So The strategic investment fund, just for a little back story, was funded originally in the 2020 budget from Mercer Mega Block sales proceeds for a variety of purposes. So There's $30 million. The",budget
"General fund, $27.2 million, and the most significant part of that is for the participatory budgeting program to continue in 2022. Rounding It out, there is a $7.6 million or 4% increase. That's General fund to the Department of Education and Early Learning. $5.4",budget
"This is for the administration of the Community Safety Capacity Building. So They were appropriating monies for capacity building that are anticipated to continue through 2022. However, This would also include ensuring that the amounts exist in 2020 budget to do the administrative side of that work. And",budget
"To restate what I think this presentation shows as it relates to the carry forward. The Carry forward is, there's no new proposed uses for those dollars. It's A carry forward for the original purpose as budgeted. Vice",budget
"The total requested increase on the 21 exceptions bill is $13.3 million. There's Really two primary notable items that are in this bill. And Again, this is an exception from a nearly $6, $7 billion prior budget, but it is still indicative of monies that were spent and higher than the budget appropriation that existed for the year. The",budget
"The exceptions ordinance is we're not providing new money. We're Just providing the authority for money that they've already spent. Is That correct? Okay,",budget
"There's really, it's sort of sporadic in terms of departments that are having exceptions to the budget authority. As Explained in the memo, the total size of the bill ranges from $5 million in 2017 to a high point of $30 million last year, and to something that if there is a sort of a regular trend in this table, about $13 million in 2018 and 2019, similar to the bill that is before you today. Though The key takeaway is that the exceptions ordinance has become and recently is a regular practice. And",budget
"As such, it kind of posed the question of, is this a regular practice at our peers? And So what I did is just, again, just kind of picked a university sample and looked at the next four largest first-class cities in Washington state and contacted their finance officials to understand if they similarly have this type of legislation as part of their budget adjustment practice. I Did not get any responses that indicated that that is a regular practice at those other cities. I",budget
"Would point out that our city of Seattle is significantly larger than their next closest first-class peers. So, And furthermore, our level of budget control is at the BCL level, which is a sort of program plus fund level of constraint, whereas some other cities, notably Tacoma, control at the fund level. So Meaning it's easier, for lack of a better word, to stay within budget when the level of fiscal control is more broad. But",budget
"Option, and this kind of builds on comments from the CBO Director Dingley at the May 4th presentation, is regular transparent budget monitoring. So This is a kind of a way to show spending against budget trends in a more consistent and public way to kind of give early advance notice that spending may exceed budget and that corrective action may be necessary. And So that action could be taken in, for example, the year-end supplemental bill that council receives. Another",budget
"Option is contingent appropriations. And So this is identifying those places and those areas where it is more likely for there to be a need to spend over budget, though it's not 100% certain and not comfortable to build into the budget itself at the department level, but provides some level of a contingent appropriation. So This is kind of similar to the Seattle Department of Constructions and Inspections has contingent authority to spend if fee revenue is higher than what they anticipated, because it's assumed that the fee revenue is to then support work that is in need of being completed in that year. So",budget
"Something along that line could be an option. I Would note that that would reduce the level of fiscal control. So When you build kind of flexibility in through a contingent appropriation, you have a little bit less budget constraint. And",budget
"There could be some thought, and we haven't really had detailed conversations of what that would look like, but something that would revise the transfer policy so that these budget exceptions could be handled at a more administrative level by CBO. But Again, similar to the option B, that would be, the trade-off would be reduced fiscal control. So Kind of one of the reasons why there is exceptions is because there is a fiscal control in place that says this is the level of authority that you have. So",budget
"Any sort of change that would kind of, I guess, release the pressure valve a bit is just logically reducing fiscal control. And Then finally, no action, of course, is an option. And I would just add here, we are in discussions with the city budget office on some of these options. And",budget
"So there is likely, if not already transmitted, soon to be transmitted an additional standalone supplemental, which would provide 2022 annual wage increases and holiday appropriations for Juneteenth and Indigenous People's Day. So That bill, I believe is going to full council because it's essentially giving appropriation authority for prior council actions, coincident with all of those prior authorizations. And Then finally, we anticipate soon to receive a mid-year supplemental that'll include a grant acceptance bill. And",budget
"Looking forward to moving us towards a true one-time mid-year supplemental, but really appreciate that we've been able to move away from especially the end of year supplemental. It Was not ideal to conclude our budgeting the last week of November just to receive a supplemental request that first week of December. Everyone Is exhausted at that point, and it's not great practice. So",budget
"And I can't remember, what was the percentage that it went down, like 30% or what was it? It was a great number. Oh, yeah, there was a Times article a couple of weeks ago that had a lot of interest in if material was returning, and material is returning, and people are returning, and kids and teens.",budget
"And I think, Chief Diaz, you and I will probably have to have a conversation along with city council around budgeting for the future related to this. I'm thinking about resources that we've allocated and resources that you have utilized. And so we'll have that discussion moving forward.",budget
"So both funding for the contract itself, as well as additional staff for SUCI to be able to monitor compliance. In conversations with the executive, it doesn't appear that there are existing funds that they would be able to use to absorb these costs. So the council may want to consider either adding funds in a supplemental budget or and during the 2023 budget process this fall that could be complicated just because of the general fund expenditures outpacing general fund revenues or projected general fund revenues and because the departments are being asked to identify reductions.",budget
"And this year, the board established a vision, values, and goals. It is in the midst of creating its budget recommendations for 2022 and 2023. And once that work is concluded, it will dive into creating a work plan for 2023 and 2024.",budget
"The, you know, with the scope of the need is for this department as well. Thank you. Madam budget Chair, appreciate your focus on those, those fiscal impacts really do. There's no",budget
"I think the important opportunity in front of us is to look at the amount of funding at the end of this year and truly make investments in upstream priorities for 2023-2024. Right now, we have a budget proviso that is in place. And if we go the route of exploring this resolution and the upcoming piece of legislation, then we are making early decisions about what is a bigger priority.",budget
"And four, extend offers more quickly in a more competitive timeframe. These are the strategies that come from within our own city department. And so in the midst of this crisis, where we are telling every single department in 2022 to hold on critical investments, things like public restrooms and outreach and education for domestic workers, we're asking folks to hold on investments that this council has prioritized along with priorities from the executive team.",budget
"And we're asking the departments, as you heard from Julie Dingley, our city budgets director in our May 4th meeting in the finance committee, to be prepared for us up to a 6% reduction across the board. I am very concerned about a resolution that authorizes us to go down a path of asking for us to invest in something that's either A, not recommended, and B, not proven. Now, again, there was some data suggested earlier that this is a proven strategy to invest in incentive programs generally.",budget
"So I'll be voting no on this resolution. I will be voting no on it for a myriad of reasons. As you've heard me talk about before, because of the city shortfall in the budget that we're experiencing and the need to use these dollars at the end of this year.",budget
This is a pivotal and exciting time for workers in the economy to finally be heard and supported. It's huge. Housing TF will set precedent countrywide in supporting workers and reclaiming from balance in these companies.,budget
It's very important. So prices go up and more people will go out. You know what this means.,budget
"And I think it's time to take a look at bringing more things into government, because right now you're eliminating a lot of really decent jobs and making them into poor jobs. And so let's take a look at that. And also, if you're successful, how many people leave the spring?",budget
"I think 15, the outcomes slide. Might be coming up. We've not gotten there yet.",budget
"And the figure that they determined was $64,000 $64,893 per person using that metric. We don't know how they arrived at that number. We're welcome to engage into a discussion with them about that.",budget
"It's as high as 60%. Now if you might recall, it was around 50% previously. Our utilization rate is around 90%.",budget
"The savings on the operations side does go into the levy fund balance. The levy fund balance covers the total inflation that exceeds 4%, which was our levy planning assumption, and of course, as everyone here knows, we are experiencing higher than 4% inflation at this time. The levy fund balance also covers unexpected costs in other levy investment areas, for example, the need for increased security of branches and other areas.",budget
"So, I think one of the things that we were doing is we were looking at either a Friday or a Monday type of situation. And one of the reasons we were looking at that is we were crafting this. This was back last year at about the times that the Clifford funds were being talked about, the federal funds were being talked about.",budget
"And we were looking at ways to use the library to give us that boost to rehire those 60, almost 70 positions that we reduced. And we were looking at, okay, what happens if we have to go backwards in this and we can't actually sustain hours moving forward if these reductions stay in place? And even as we move forward, knowing that budget reductions are always a potential reality, we were looking at ways that we could use the library to give us a boost so that if we can't move forward as far as we want to in either pre-pandemic services or even in expanded hours, that we're letting our public provide some input into that process of where we would make that selection.",budget
"And then lastly, I'm going to finish up with how those particular costs translate into and what it would mean or what it might mean for the city budget for 2022 and 2023. So that's our plan. And with that, I would just go ahead and turn it over to Otto to give some context for how we got to negotiations and how the negotiating team move forward with its directions from the LRPC.",budget
Although I think the financial sections will go fast. Okay. I'm just trying to keep everyone on our time.,budget
"So first off, we have changes to wages, including wage increases. So CPI here is the Consumer Price Index. That's a calculation of averages based on how much more goods cost.",budget
"And so we have those numbers for 2020, 2021, 2022. 2023, that 4% is the cap. So just so you know, if for some reason CPI gets calculated much higher than 4%, the contract still has a 4% cap in it.",budget
"So we can anticipate the cost, even though we aren't in 2023 yet. There's the precinct commander premium. It's currently at 5%, changing it to 6% in 2022.",budget
And counsel president with your permission. I'll just finish up quickly on the. On the financial implications.,budget
"So the way that the city normally. Handles contracts like this is that that amount of money, the 3.4 million is being held by the city budget office in an account that is being used to pay for the contract. And so if the contract is sent over, the city budget office would also send over separate legislation or a supplemental budget.",budget
At least as we know and have forecasted at this moment of time. Could there be more salary savings in future? I don't think so.,budget
And the use of the funds and the BCL are all aligned. That's correct. Thank you.,budget
"And then we'll have future continue to have these budget discussions as we move into the supplemental budget conversations later this, this summer. Thank you, Ellie Casper. Yeah, I'm just in closing.",budget
One in the short form. Arts and entertainment. Category.,budget
"So that's, that shows you the power of the film economy. All right. Just to highlight, because we're out of time.",budget
Like how many? 30 million? I see yesterday in TV.,budget
"Yeah, something like this. So my question right now to you guys, for 10 years, we have red camera, 50 percentage money go to Arizona Corporation. We're talking about million and million dollars per year.",budget
"It is simply accepting a grant today. Typically in my committee, I have a rule. It is not a required rule.",budget
So that's just a look at the budget process. CBO has also been working on internal changes and I'll pass it on to William to cover that. Thanks.,budget
"Together, you raise prices for the last year. And this year, another 10% almost $200. So you do very good job.",budget
I do have a couple of questions about the numbers. I think this question might be for Tracy by central staff. So the--how much money are we talking about?,budget
"And obviously that amount, the $15 million could change, depending on the amount of proceeds that come in. But this year, we know it's about $15.7 million. Thank you.",budget
"This authorizes the human services Department to accept six grants from the state and Federal agencies, totaling $3 million 226,000. And appropriates the budget authority that is tied to the grant agreement. I want to thank acting director Tanya Kim and Joseph Kasperski from the human services Department for joining us to walk through the grants.",budget
Are there any additional comments or questions? Yes. Just want to inquire about the staffing capacity to complete the work required for these grants.,budget
"How people will access it . what it will pay for. And also, what specific funds will it pay for. And for what population?",budget
How people will access it. What it will pay for. It will be executed with our current staff on board.,budget
Or from additional Federal dollars if those dollars can help offset some of the funding that we provided in our 2022 budget. That would be great. To say that there's going to be Les dollars.,budget
"But if they're able to supplant existing general fund used. That would be helpful to know, especially given the specific budget situation we're facing. And I know we're all interested in utilizing every dollar available that might be Nongeneral fund related.",budget
"It seems like there should be some logic or policy rationale or value of the dollar associated with the city investment. Are there any other questions from colleagues? Just to clarify, I want to clarify something from the presentation.",budget
"I don't want to lose sight of what sort of the overall policy goals are for the use of the lines of business. We hear you on maintaining the transparency and--I think reporting and visibility of the initiatives in the budget. Okay, all right.",budget
"Actually related to that superintendent Williams, I don't know if this question is too premature, but does the Department at this time anticipate carrying over all of those line items from the previous cycle or places where the Department anticipates consolidations and Reapportionments in some of the initial recommendations that you guys will send down? And now feel free to tell me we'll be talking about this a lot over the summer. Yeah.",budget
"I mean I could say high level, you know, I think the way we talk about what we consider Precommitments internally is that funding at least to us recognizes that for the first ten years between, you know, the year 2000 and well I guess 14 years, in 2014 that we had taken significant levels of budget cuts and reductions. To the Department and our ability to operate staff community centers, maintain our parks, do our facility maintenance. And we have thought about that baseline as a way to fact filling sort of ensuring that we continue to back fill those reductions going forward.",budget
"And so a lot of the funding on the operating side would mean that for example in community centers, you might reduce hours at community centers, for example, right? Or have some other unintended consequence across the system. That's how we got to kind of a conclusion that we felt like what's included in that description of baseline was really just bolstering the Department's operations from years of prior budget reductions.",budget
In today's committee meeting we hope to continue that discussion. First the Seattle department of construction and inspections commonly referred to by the initials SDCI will present about how they investigate and enforce renters' rights and what powers they have and do not have to intervene when a renter calls themselves a renter. The second item on the agenda is the city of Seattle office of renters.,housing
The city of Seattle office of renters is responsible for reporting on renters' experiences when their rights were violated and their attempts to get redressal. My office is regularly contacted by renters who are having their rights violated. Sometimes their landlord has broken the law and other times they are subjected to conditions that are unacceptable but are not illegal such as outrageously violent.,housing
My office regularly conducts enforcement procedures with the experts at the housing justice project and at the SDCI. My office is gathering examples of where the city's enforcement procedures need to improve. We need to develop legislation out of this committee meetings to overhaul how renters' rights are enforced.,housing
"I want to be clear that when renters e-mail my office to report abuses we often give them information about how to contact the SDCI or the housing justice project. We are able to help renters solve their problems. However, just the magnitude, the number of instances where renters have problems far, far outweigh what we are able to do in this kind of method.",housing
So the point of the discussion is not to say that renters can never get justice because that is not true. The point of the discussion is to find the loopholes and close them recognizing the fact that the problem is very widespread and prevalent. It's not just an unusual thing or a handful of renters that face these problems.,housing
"It's all over the city. I want to give a few examples of the problems we have found in Seattle's enforcement of renters' rights. My office has spoken to renters who have gone for months without heat, no hot water, holes in their ceilings, walls and floors, mold or pest infestation that has persisted as I said for months, doors that are not secure and so many other unacceptable housing conditions that are also legal violations of Seattle's housing codes.",housing
"Seattle's rental inspection ordinance requires buildings to be inspected but most buildings are inspected by private inspection companies that are clearly willing to sign on to anything based on some of the conditions we have seen. If a renter calls the complaint line of the SDCI, often a city inspector will visit the property, the city inspectors are responsible and do a serious inspection once they come to the property. However, that can only happen after a renter calls the complaint line and obviously most renters do not ordinarily even know, they're not even aware that they have this option of calling the SDCI and lodging a complaint.",housing
"When renters do call, it is when they are truly, and this is what we have observed on most of the instances, when they call, it is when they truly are at their wits' end and they have someone like the tenants' union, be Seattle or the staff in Mount office letting them know that they have this option. Renters have many reasons to fear reporting violations because there is no rent control in Washington state. Renters worry that if they ask their landlord for repairs, that could motivate their landlord to raise the rent.",housing
"And that is a commonly feared intimidation or retaliation that renters have reported to us. When it's true or not, whether it's true or not, it is something that every renter has spoken to things about. Whether it happens in a given case or not, it is something renters really fear.",housing
"The reason they fear is that it happens often. My office talked to a renter several years ago whose bathroom was so dilapidated, she paid to install a new shower herself. When her landlord saw the improved bathroom, they raised the rent because they thought they could get more for the improved apartment.",housing
"That's just outrageous. When a renter truly cannot take the conditions anymore and gets an inspector from the SDCI to visit the property, then the landlord is required to make repairs in a reasonable timeline or face possible fines. But that clock to complete repairs does not start when the problem occurred or even when the renter first contacted the landlord about the problem, the clock starts only after SDCI inspectors visit the property.",housing
"So the renters who have, for example, been suffering with no heat for months prior to the incident, they have no justice for that time. They still have to pay the full rent for all that time. Even when a landlord fails to complete the repairs in the time required by SDCI, they are not necessarily fined.",housing
"In order to issue a fine, SDCI must first send the details of the violation to the city attorney's office and then the city attorney's office needs to take the landlord to court and win a judgment for the fines. In practice, this means that SDCI has to issue a fine before completing collecting fines. Citywide SDCI issued five fines, only five fines to landlords in all of 2021 combined.",housing
"This is yet another example of how the rich and powerful in our society are being held to a completely different standard by the legal system. Even when the city does levy a fine, nowhere in Seattle's law is the renter compensated for the rent they ended up paying during the time when those inadequate or dilapidated conditions persisted. In my experience, the staff who work at the SDCI investigating abuses by landlords are dedicated to their work, but the structure of the system is totally stacked against renters.",housing
"One example that SDCI brought to the attention to my office is the enforcement of the law prohibiting landlords from entering a rented apartment without giving notice unless there's an emergency. Under Seattle's law, if a landlord breaks this law, they are issued a notice of violation that essentially says they have to correct the problem which is accomplished the moment they leave the apartment because the problem is them entering the apartment without notice. If they do it again, they get another notice.",housing
"In order to actually get a penalty, the landlord would need to enter your apartment without notice, stay in the apartment until the renter contacts the SDCI, SDCI issues a notice of violation, and they remain in the apartment until the landlord contacts the SDCI. The third and final agenda item today is a briefing on a bill sponsored by council member Peterson that I support which adds information about the amount of rent charged to the data landlords are charging themselves. We will hear specific examples when we get to agenda item two where we have renters and renter advocates speaking to us.",housing
"Is the city taking a balanced approach to all housing providers, public housing, nonprofit, and private housing providers? What is the proportion of code violations in each of these sectors? Remember that the city has lost 10% of rental housing registrations in just the last eight months.",housing

"According to RRIO data, the city is hemorrhaging small locally owned rental properties.

"That is making renovations to apartment buildings in a manner that makes them unlivable, thereby getting people to self-evict and avoiding regulations around rent increases and paying relocation assistance. Cadence Realty, famous for this kind of renoviction at the Chateau Apartments, is doing that to my building.

"They had threatened to do this twice before. When it was 25 degrees out. SDCI will not recognize this as a complaint because landlords have permits and the issues are transitory, even if repeated.",housing
"Our landlord, C, has blatantly neglected awful conditions of our building and has ignored repeatedly complaints for years, which is why we have been organizing alongside City Councilman Sharma Shawant's office for better conditions.

There's complaints about an extra burden being placed on landlords in the context of a tsunami of regulation.",housing
"What about the burden of the exploding rent on the renters who cannot afford to stay in their homes anymore? What about the tsunami of renters who are getting kicked out of their homes to prevent the end of this eviction moratorium?

Our last speaker who is showing us present is Stanley Stokes.",housing
"Our part of that is enforcing compliance with a very wide range of regulations. We have inspectors who work out in the field and have been, for the most part, out in the field. And then we have a rental housing program that is focused on the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants.",housing
"But POTA, Property Owner and Tenant Assistance, that is the group of our folks who deal with most of the rights and responsibilities, questions about evictions, many of the other requirements that we try to explain in some of our public information. I also mentioned briefly the rental registration and inspection ordinance. So that program requires rental housing providers to register with us and to be inspected, not frequently, but at least once every 10 years.",housing
"Some of them are inspected at least once every five years. TRAEO, Tenant Relocation Assistance Ordinance, when tenants are displaced by development or by a change of use, they can be eligible, if they're very low income, for relocation assistance. And then the new ordinance that Council passed last fall on economic displacement and relocation assistance.",housing
"So that's an important part of our work that we've built up over the last few years. We have an extensive outreach program that includes our web portal, which is seattle.gov forward slash renting in Seattle, and that contains a lot of information about rights and best practices for renters and tips for landlords. We've got our two phone lines, our renting in Seattle phone line at 206-684-5700 and our code compliance complaint line at 206-615-0808.",housing
"We also have a number of housing complaints. There are housing complaints. That's the term we use for housing conditions, like broken sink or the heat not working.",housing
"And then we've got our renters' rights complaints that come to the POTA group that Faith talked about, and those are usually rent increases, lease questions, and such. And so far, 2022 seems to be on track to be even greater than that. That's just a handful of common complaints.",housing
"This is certainly not an exhaustive list. On the housing side, kitchens and bathrooms come up a lot, just because there's so many things that can go wrong, leaky faucets and moisture problems, ventilation problems. Pests, rodents, bugs, bedbugs keep coming up.",housing
"Security issues, like locks and windows, and then fire safety, smoke, inoperable smoke detectors or CO detectors are very common. On the rental housing side, the landlord-tenant issues, deposit returns, rent increases, eviction notices. As Councilmember Sawant mentioned, entry without proper notice are some pretty common issues that come up.",housing
"Especially here in the last few months, the rent increases and the eviction notices have been probably the most prevalent things we're hearing right now. Looking at case resolution, this sort of supports some slides that are coming up. You can see over the years that we have kind of a 50-50, 40-60 split of what we call enforced compliance and voluntary compliance.",housing
"The voluntary compliance usually, and this is all of our code compliance cases. We didn't break this down to just landlord-tenant issues, so this does include a few other types of things we deal with, like junk storage or vacant buildings. Overall, it's this 60-40 split with a small percentage going to the law department.",housing
That's how we come in. We like to do problem-solving first because we find it resolves the issues faster. It keeps tenants in their homes and helps promote a better relationship with the landlord and the tenants in the long run.,housing
"How our process works when we get a housing complaint or a renter's rights complaint is, first of all, they call on one of our two numbers or reach us by website. They make their complaint and that goes to a team of people who then sends them over to a supervising manager who then assigns it to an inspector or a code compliance analyst. They do that based on how many cases the person already has as well as the area the inspector works in.",housing
The staff work through their complaints and questions in the order they're received except for emergency housing conditions and eviction problems. Those get always priority in our office. We use several tools to get our compliance.,housing
"The first most important thing is after the complaint comes in, we talk to the renter and find out what's going on. Then we talk to the landlord. The landlords either present their notices, issue the deposit return or make repairs based on our contact with them and telling them about the issue or by sometimes notice of violation and sometimes just by phone depending on the type of complaint.",housing
16 of them were from one very severe property. Physical issues with the living space always get a notice of violation and the notice of violation comes with the compliance due date. We have to give at least 10 days for an appeal and usually we give 30 days to comply.,housing
"Some of the challenges we face with housing inspections are inspectors have to make appointments with the person to walk through during business hours, but that's the way we get access to the unit is through the tenant who lives there. Many renters call just as they're moving out and inspectors aren't able to get to the property in time to inspect. Sometimes issues just get fixed before we get there which is a good problem to have.",housing
"We have 143 open housing cases which are in the notice of violation process and 317 open housing complaints. The POTA group, as we said, they do the renter's rights, has 46 open notice of violation, but they have 921 complaints and questions waiting for them. Sometimes those complaints are already in the investigation process so it's important to know that complaints can be already being talked to and trying to resolve the problem before a case is opened.",housing
"They also got compensation for it. I don't want to suggest it's the rule, it's the exception to the rule but it shows when renters get organized and fight for their rights it can actually work like that. Thank you.",housing
"I'm going to go ahead and start with one question for starters. In terms of the process you all explained about how the SDCI works through complaints, one of the points you mentioned and my office has been aware of this for a while and it was reiterated on your slide 13 I believe that the SDCI is able to inspect before they leave which of course is consistent with what we have seen through renters just anecdotally that it's the last resort and often they don't know that they could have called the SDCI for a long time and eventually find out but by then conditions are so bad or they have persisted for so long that they just ended up choosing to move which is not the last resort but they have chosen to move. My question in terms of the process for the city is is there anything in the law right now where the SDCI is required to inspect even after that tenant leaves because it's about that rental unit and if the renter moves then that renter is not facing that particular problem but some other renter, the next tenant is going to face that problem and we've heard from many renters who say that I moved out and finally out of desperation but I really feel for the next tenant who occupies that unit after I leave and so I believe this happens frequently enough and it really also illustrates the terrible power imbalance between renters and landlords but what does the law say right now and the reason I'm asking obviously is because if it doesn't require that the city should inspect even if the renter has left the tenant who made the complaint has left but still the unit still needs to be inspected.",housing
Right now we are not able to require a landlord to let us into a unit if they don't want to so the only exception to that is through the rental inspection program we do have those regularly established RIO rental registration and inspection ordinance inspections. If we find through a RIO inspection that there are units several units with several other additional units or all units to be inspected it is sometimes in theory it's possible to get a warrant to go into a particular unit that a tenant may have vacated but getting a warrant requires going to court and proving showing that there is a forgotten which legal standard we have to meet to get a warrant but it has to be it's not beyond a reasonable doubt but there's a preponderance or a very clear statement that there are real problems so we would not be able to speak to that very few tenants are willing to come and testify in court because you know they're busy they're working they just moved there so getting warrants we never have we have always we can call a landlord and ask we can say we got this complaint right now because of the backlog we probably wouldn't have the capacity to start a program like that but for us finding a way to assure a tenant that we can help them and that we have requirements to prevent retaliation is what we found is best I mean clearly we're getting more calls so more tenants are learning but as you heard today people do wait they will wait months and that is something we wish we could prevent right thank you I really appreciate that and that's precisely why we are yeah we my office genuinely wants to make sure that we close all the problems I mean obviously it's not going to change the system by itself but at least if we can reduce the problems that are there within the loopholes in the current law and just to follow up on that I mean I just also wanted to clarify that one of the reasons and you sort of address this but one of the reasons tenants don't follow up and even when they know that they have a they can complain to the STCA they don't do that not only because they're they do it when they're as I said before but also they do have a fear of retaliation and then they reported often and tenants have told us this they reported but as they're about to move out because they want to make sure the next tenant can have a better living condition but clearly the law is not addressing that because as you said the landlords are not required by the current law to let STCA into the unit you can enter the unit as a city inspector only when the tenant lets you in and I think the intimidation and retaliation obviously is a big point here but I also wanted to one follow up on one thing you said you know you know you said as you said the Rio allows you to inspect you know allows you to look into the conditions but Isn't it true that the landlord is free to choose a private inspector and then if they chose a private inspector as opposed to the STCA inspector themselves then STCA does not really get access to that kind of inspection they look at the private inspectors report am I right?,housing
That's true so the law requires that we offer the ability for a landlord to hire a private inspector if they do that if they hire a private inspector they need to inspect and don't want to share their data with us then they have to inspect all their units we have pretty good inspectors but I will admit we have had some inspectors who have been a little bit lax Jeff your program Rio runs that we we work pretty hard we do some follow-up surveys with tenants to see what they've had we try to encourage people who feel dissatisfied with that private inspection to contact us but again it's sometimes really really hard to get people to trust government and it's hard sometimes to get the private landlords to trust government you know to feel like they're doing a good job they're doing a good job they're doing a good job they're doing a good job and then we'll do a good inspection and not you know take them to court over a loose electrical outlet cover so so it's a it's a balance yes I'll just say though that we are so far not having major problems and I'm not a housing inspector but I would imagine that other than you know broken furnace or anything like that the black mold and roach infestation these are long term conditions they don't these conditions don't develop in one day so clearly these are conditions that have been neglected for months maybe even years so I do think that the proposed legislation just a note for myself I think that I think that we need to make sure that we address that aspect as well in terms of you know who is doing the inspection and how what we know what is the quality of that inspection report because it's not like it happened in one day Councilmember Morales I do have other questions but I wanted to invite Councilmember Morales and then the other council members please indicate if you want to speak thank you thanks for this presentation sorry I just lost my notes here we go okay so I have kind of two questions the first is that last year we were working to provide greater protection through the just cause eviction ordinance we learned that that ordinance would need to be updated to reflect changes at the state level so I'm interested in a progress report on that but regarding this you I guess I want to zoom out a little bit because you talked about all the different things that your inspectors are responsible for in addition to the housing issues and so we don't have to answer this now but I'm interested in you know how many inspectors you have what's the backlog on the non-housing issues the average number of cases per inspector how long does it take to resolve those other cases because as you said if there's more things that your inspectors are responsible for and as a result some of these renters aren't getting the service that they need that sounds to me like we need to perhaps increase your capacity to be able to do the things we're asking you to do so if you can answer any of those now that'd be great if not I would like to follow up with you and get some of that information I think what I would like to do on your second question is defer for a week or 10 days we are just wrapping up our year-end report for the code compliance division which we typically send to the council the mayor's office and then post on our website and that will I believe cover most everything that you've asked and then we'd be happy to answer any more specific questions once you've had a chance to see our annual report that does cover the whole spectrum of everything the code compliance division does I'm going to turn it over to Jeff for an update on that reconciliation bill of what happened at state and city in the last couple years yeah we've been working on it we've been talking with the law department we've got we sort of know the broad strokes of where recent state changes intersect with the city law and where we need to make some adjustments I think a lot of it's going to be very technical in nature way down deep in the code language just correcting some terminology and such we held back a little bit to see where the state legislative session would go this year and as far as I know there were no additional changes so I think we're just about ready to pick that up I mean capacity on our part and capacity on the council's part to be ready to receive it I think is just a discussion we probably need to have through through the council staff there and decide when the right time is thank you for those responses and I would also be interested in the responses to those to the question that was asked by council member Morales because all of that information would be very relevant for us to understand the scope of the problems so that it will help us in drafting this new legislation I I have questions but I wanted to wait for other council members to have an opportunity to ask questions or make comments I don't see any so let me just quickly go ahead and ask a couple here one is and I don't know if you already answered this in the process of answering questions but do you do an inspection every time a renter requests one and how often does that happen I mean like what is the nature of how you do it often like does it often require that or does it always require that and also can you give us a sense of how in the pandemic era in the lockdown era you you all mentioned that you switch to virtual to some degree I mean doesn't seem like it would work for everything but to what extent did you use it and I'm specifically asking that also because in the panel that's coming up in the next agenda item one of the speakers is going to speak one of the renters they say that they did they did send a complaint to the STC I believe it was during the lockdown period I'm not positive about that but in any case they didn't receive a response so I'm wondering if you know if you had issues also with getting back to people last year just because of all the backlog as we were just discussing and also to what degree do they have these virtual inspections worked Michelle can you speak to that with how your inspection groups are handling that yes so it wasn't only a small number of cases where we were able to use virtual inspections to be successful but they were successful and reinspections particularly were easier for us to do because we'd already been in the housing and identified the problems but we had about 81 virtual inspections last year we'll be continuing to work on how we can use those as a tool when a tenant doesn't want us to come into their unit for whatever reason it's true though that our virtual inspections they they don't give us a full view of everything that is in the unit it's really hard it's hard to smell if it's mildewy and it's hard to touch a surface and see if it's spongy they're okay for some things we probably miss a lot but maybe we get the one thing the tenant was calling about I my impression Michelle is that most housing inspections do get or housing complaints do get a a physical inspection now when we can reach the tenant so we lose some but if the tenant wants us there we will get there it's a long process and it now is taking quite a while but as I say it may take three or four weeks or more these days but we are committed to inspecting anytime a tenant will let us in okay that's definitely helpful and I will go ahead and ask one more question I will have to follow up with you offline and we will definitely do that because this discussion and your presentation has definitely provoked some useful questions I think that will help us draft this bill one question that I wanted to ask right now though before closing this agenda item is does the city attorney's office in your experience ever refuse to take a case to court after you request them to do so and generally speaking what are the parameters that are used to take the legal avenue I would say it's very rare for them to refuse but I can they have on occasion when our case is not fantastic they often are reluctant to take a case that is in compliance and we have had cases where in a particularly egregious situation we wanted penalties and so they have taken a couple of those part of it is their workload and the other cases that they don't want to take a case that they think they're definitely going to lose every once in a while we have a disagreement about the law and they get to make that decision sometimes we issue notices and they tell us I don't think you guys are right that happened once a couple years ago made me unhappy but we wound up settling that case so we have a good working relationship with the city attorney's office so and I think my team does a very good job of interpreting the code and applying it out in the field so that we do build good cases most of the time right that was also very useful thank you Faith and I have a last question but one last question is are there is I believe I know the answer to this question but I'm going to ask anyway are there penalties like legally are there penalties for landlords for retaliation or harassment related to the STCA process there are penalties the retaliation provisions are you know it's actually fairly strong retaliation provision so if a tenant complains to us and the next month after their landlord fixes whatever he raises their rent we are able to say that appears to be retaliation you need to hold off on that rent increase you can't do anything that decreases services or increases costs for 90 days after a tenant complains to us however the retaliation provisions are in the regular housing code and under the housing code we only issue notices of violation so if they raise the rent in retaliation for a tenant making a complaint their compliance is to withdraw that rent increase and then they'd be in compliance and we wouldn't proceed to penalize them so not it's very unusual for us to actually collect a penalty we don't have citation authority for retaliation actions we can only issue notices of violation that that and we want people we'd rather them to withdraw the rent increase then collect $500 from them and how often have you penalized landlords in that way like how often has that happened to actually go to court on a retaliation claim I don't think we ever have Michelle you may recall or Jeff no we haven't yeah landlords do typically just rescind the notice and so that's that's how we get compliance right so we we have not really imposed penalties for anything like that okay it comes up somewhat regularly and we do we do address it yeah but yeah again the landlords just rescind the notices okay and actually all of this is also highlighting how there is no I mean there's one big hole here in law overall where the tenants get no redress so even if the conditions are fixed as you report you do get compliance once a complaint is lodged most of the time however you know for example if the heating was off in winter for three weeks the the rent the tenant is still paying the full rent for that month so there is there is nothing that the tenant can do to get compensated you know get any monetary compensation for the really bad condition I mean that's not a minor thing not having heat in a cold winter on a cold winter day that's that's a really you know that's an egregious thing and so we yeah it is it is it is a it is a problem and also even under the even even in the instances where you're talking about where you say you say that you know you prefer that they comply with the law and then you the pressure of that maybe forces them to rescind that rent increase and all of that but one question that raises is if the landlords have the option of just reversing their retaliation they don't actually face penalties for attempting to retaliate how do you or how does your department feel that would discourage continuation of these practices and I know Ted also has a question but but yeah please go ahead and answer that I guess I don't really I'm not sure I know how to answer that I think in our experience the more landlords know the better most of them really like to avoid us even though we work to be neutral they still really like to avoid us so for us we have been most successful when we do outreach and education and they regardless of penalties that might or might not get imposed landlords they don't want to deal with us they're they want us to be happy and go away so for us avoiding things like retaliation is a lot about education at least right now okay thank you and Ted you had a question my question was along those lines I just wanted to confirm what we heard earlier that the city attorney's office is reluctant to take a landlord to court if the landlord is in compliance and so I think that's what I heard so just if I understand what that means if there's a landlord who for example had a repair that they were supposed to complete and they didn't do it within the time frame and then they started to accrue those penalties of $150 a day and time goes on and those penalties build up and then eventually eventually you and SDCI get to the point where you say okay something has to be done here you send it to the city attorney's office the city attorney's office is now looking at bringing them to court and at that point the landlord says uh oh okay I'm going to fix it so now they're in compliance does that mean that the city attorney's office now says okay forget about all those fines that accrue if they're in compliance now yeah you know I would say if in the situation you just described I think at that point if it had gone on for so long and was so bad that we referred it and then they complied in those cases we do frequently collect a penalty we just don't see it so much with housing code issues so we they do work with us if we say this was just a completely egregious case and we want some penalties and we feel like we need to make a point they will work with us it's not a forever but it has to be really bad I actually do see the exact situation that Ted just described we see that frequently with people who have built things without building permits and it often takes the threat or an actual lawsuit to get them to go through the building permit process and when those come into compliance we do usually collect some number of thousands of dollars you know five or ten or more depending on the issue so it's not unheard of I just think most of our landlords do fix things before it gets to be really really egregious thank you everyone from the department of construction inspections we'll definitely be following up with you because we're going to be working on this proposed legislation and I just in closing this out and starting the next agenda item I do want to it seems pretty striking to me just in terms of the law this is not a comment on the SDC as we've said many times the staff are extremely helpful and knowledgeable and committed to the work but in terms of the the status quo of what both the legal requirements on landlords and also just the social dynamic of the landlord landlords having far more power than renters it is I cannot help but be struck by the overwhelming contrast between how if renters don't pay their rent the law is applied aggressively I'm not this is not an advocacy for not paying your rent obviously everyone has to comply with the law and and in our experience overwhelmingly renters try very very hard to pay their rent and overwhelmingly I mean I can't actually remember a single instance where when the rent was not paid or was not paid on time it was not because of financial desperation when renters are in financial dire straits that is the only time when they fall short we've heard of instances where tenants were taken to court just for falling short by three dollars I mean this is not a made up thing it is an actual thing that happened and that tenant bravely fought and defeated her eviction notice but the point is that the law is applied so aggressively against renters and on the other side it seems that the landlords can get a friendly reminder yes they can get fined in some cases but they are you know they get so many chances to do the right thing I just find that really glaring and we do have to do something about it and I'm not pretending that this one legislation is going to fix that it is an important thing however but it also just highlights the nature of the so called housing market in our system and how much how disproportionate the power is between landlords that landlords have against their tenants and I also wanted to just also mention that and this is specifically what we want to follow up with the SDCI about we hear that there is compliance on a timely manner but that's not what we are hearing from renters I mean we just heard the tenants of Rainier Court and this is not the first time we've heard from them in public comment and I have personally my staff and I we have visited that location many many times we have witnessed those conditions and those conditions aren't being fixed I mean I think some of them have been fixed but overwhelmingly they still those conditions still languish so we would definitely want to follow up with the SDCI specifically on that issue as well and I want renters who are watching this to reach out to us if you haven't already done so so now I want to switch to item number two where we have a renter and renter advocate panel and I realize that we are running a little bit late but that was because we had a good problem which is many people members of the public showing up for public comment but I want to start quickly with the two renters we have on our panel and then we will call on the renter advocate so first we have Jesse Seiden sorry if I'm saying your name wrong from a Wallingford apartment building Jesse please introduce yourself for the record and then make your comments and then I'll call on the next speaker hello everyone so I was living in the Audrey apartment complex in Fremont and on February 25th in the morning it burnt the front end of the building burnt down the first four apartments and shortly after the next day the whole place was robbed because the rent the apartment sorry the landlords did not properly secure the building and we were all looted they just kicked open the doors there was nothing that was there was no security that they were supposed to do in a vacated building because we were told that we couldn't even live there and after just after the fact really had no assistance besides the the Red Cross to help me transition into a new place and since then they have just the renter the landlords haven't assisted us at all they try to have us sign a document to just get our security deposits back and then thus not having anything to do with us after the fact So Luckily we all banded together and made sure that we did not sign that but yeah just completely have felt neglected the entire time having to deal with with my stuff luckily things are getting better but literally the most dramatic experience my and I should mention also there were no alarms that were going off at all and we all made sure that ours all were working and had batteries but I woke up to my fellow neighbor pounding on my door saying that there was a fire and I had to get up out so I could have died so yeah that's that's why that's my say thank you for listening thank you so much Jesse and if you're able to stay please stay I just it is just horrendous what you were put through and I I definitely think we should talk to you and your fellow tenants you know or previous fellow tenants to make sure that at the very least at this point your rights are being met I'm really glad to hear that you did not sign that document I read through that document it is outrageous that the landlord attempted to do that and as you said you know you could have lost your life had your neighbors not warned you so thank you so much for sharing that story and we have Ellen Anderson next who is also a renter in the city go ahead Ellen introduce yourself and then make your points thank you hi I'm Ellen I'm a full time student studying psychology at Seattle Central and I live in District 2 in Beacon Hill I just want to thank you say thank you to Council Member Swann and her office for inviting me here I think the experience that I'm sharing with the committee today is you know pretty common and yeah so the rental home that we lived in is about the rental home that we lived in until about three months ago so everyone in our house of four roommates is under 35 has decent jobs but finding housing was still super difficult for us I love my housemates but like most young people living communally is not like some lifestyle choice it's an economic necessity and even with four incomes we don't have the luxury of prioritizing quality housing over cheap housing so when we moved into our house five years ago we were super excited because the rent was quote unquote reasonable for Seattle standards meaning that it was actually an affordable rent with our pooled incomes the house had a big backyard a fireplace and was on a convenient bus line but from the start we knew that the house was going to have a lot of problems but what kept us there despite these problems was the fact that in five years that we lived there our rent never got raised and anyone who's been a renter in the city knows that in the last decade rent increases have been out of control and unfortunately two of our roommates came to our house trying to escape a rat infestation at their previous home but unfortunately we battled a super intense rat infestation in this house as well and that lasted for months and we begged our landlord to call exterminators I personally spent hundreds of dollars on pest traps I slept in our living room on and off for months because the sound of rats fighting in the walls would keep me up at night and I paid the full amount of rent for both of those months fearing that if I didn't we would all be evicted our landlord faced no consequences we ended up having to deal with the whole situation ourselves and not a dollar was cut from the rent we had to pay to compensate time or money that we put in and the months of stress and difficulties that we faced over the course of the five years we never missed rent we never paid late we worked hard to improve the spaces that we were living in despite the fact that we did not own it we gardened we painted we rewired where necessary but the final straw was when I woke up one morning I put my feet down and I realized that I was standing in seven inches of standing water the response from our landlord was laughably inadequate they drilled holes in the foundation for what they told us was so that in the future the flood water would have a place to drain and gave me a large fan to put in my basement room the room still reeked of persistent damp really moldy smell and surely the drywall and baseboards which were warped and clearly full of water were compromised and the flooring was never replaced the landlord's explanation was that a tree root was growing into the foundation and had cracked it which indicated very serious and dangerous structural issues with the entire house and the leak from the other side of the basement they had no explanation other than it had rained very heavily which is common in Seattle and that's just what happens in houses sometimes and I think that this really drives home the horrible reality facing renters where if we skip our rent once we could be evicted and made homeless but our landlords could and would leave us in unlivable and dangerous conditions and face no consequences,housing
"One of my housemates filed an online complaint on the SDCI website to request a housing inspection because we were increasingly concerned that the entire house was not safe for occupation and highlighted that in my room particularly was completely unlivable unfortunately we never heard back from SDCI by phone or email and we were forced to move out of the house I fear for the future tenants who are going to move in because the reality of renting is that it's super easy in the short term to hide damage in this situation from floods and mold without addressing the fact that this house needs major structural repairs and likely should not be inhabited until those repairs are carried out I have no doubt that SDCI especially hearing from just now hearing from them like many other resources in Seattle are underfunded and incredibly backed up with requests we're really lucky we're in a position to be able to barely afford to move but the move basically drained the bank accounts of everyone in our house and the fact that the global COVID pandemic and the economic crisis has not ended really means that our house that me and my housemates are one paycheck away from a major or one injury not being able to pay rent this makes it incredibly shameful I think that the majority of the city council voted to repeal the eviction moratorium on top of the pandemic and the worsening house crisis and we've seen now in our new house we're paying almost twice as much rent and we've lived here for two and a half almost three months and we're already struggling with our new landlord not addressing broken appliances or leaks that we're finding in our house that we noticed the day we moved in and I think this is why we need rent control and to support the kind of legislation that we're seeing council members and WAP put forward we really need to strengthen tenants rights because I think if this experience has taught me anything that landlords are going to continue to prioritize profits and not housing thank you very much for listening me out thank you thank you Ellen for sharing that story and we have follow up points for Jesse and you both so if you're able to stay that would be great can we have Tram Larson go next thank you Tram hi good morning thanks for having me so my name is Tram I use she her pronouns I'm the community engagement manager at the housing justice project I just want to start this off by saying that we are very appreciative of SDCI we have a close relationship with them you know the tenants that make their way to our clinic because they're getting evicted are generally you know facing some type of habitability issues at their apartment so you know those we try and connect them with SDCI I so I will will just say though I have a lot of friends just personally that aren't aware of SDCI so I think this is just a larger issue of capacity for them but also just getting the word out there so you know supporting you know council members So once you know proposal would allow it would be great if we could have like a tenant advocate you know those groups that would be able to enforce discrimination laws the city ordinances just because SDCI isn't able to do that they have very limited power to be able to enforce the laws you know they can't seek injunctions a lot of what they do is reacting to complaints you know issuing notice violations but like they said if the landlord stops doing that you know then the case is closed but if we could have tenant advocates like HAP or the tenants union or be Seattle who are generally probably in contact with a lot more tenants than SDCI is we would be able to bring those cases forward right on behalf of the tenants and get them some type of relief rather than just kind of waiting and hoping on the inspection happens because the landlord can just stop doing it and Then you know once they've been issued a notice and then they can resume it again I'll just share an example of a tenant that I was working with during the moratorium who was still paying rent but they called us because they hadn't had water for over two years they you know this was not an issue that was raised SDCI because they didn't speak English and so there's you know there's so there are so many reasons that tenants aren't able to reach out to SDCI and we were able to make contact with the landlord and try and get it resolved but eventually you know after months and months of going back and forth it turned out that there was an actual issue with the water pipes it had been damaged during construction of townhomes and the landlord just opted not to fix it and so and they didn't technically have to and eventually you know SDCI issued a notice and that the building you know that the house wasn't habitable and the tenant didn't have anywhere to go but during this entire process the landlord was still collecting rent and they were they actually raised the rent quite significantly for this tenant who is on you know very limited income just due to their age and not they didn't have the ability to work so it's situations like that you know where the tenants are in contact with us and it would have been great if we were able to do something on their behalf and get them some type of relief and damages but we don't have that power currently and neither does SDCI so I think if we could establish something like that that would be wonderful I understand like not all landlords are bad but there are you know some landlords that aren't doing what they should be doing and those tenants shouldn't be you know just left out and left there to just kind of figure it out themselves and hope for the best I think like as a society we should be protecting vulnerable folks from being exploited like that Thank you so much Tram I definitely agree I mean I know good landlords there was a good landlord who testified today who said she supported this legislation and I know others as well but at the end of the day this is this is also a question of what laws we have and also if landlords are being good to their tenants they're not going to be affected by these legislation in any way right I mean this is the point that we've been repeatedly making that if you're not mistreating your tenants and not exploiting them then it's not going to affect you similarly if you're not having skyrocketing rent then rent control policy will not affect you because you're treating your tenants in in a decent manner but just before I go to Kate next Tram I just wanted to clarify did you say that the tenant you talked to did not have water for two years yes he did not have water for two years was still paying rent every month and paying for his own water he literally had to go buy those jugs of water to be able to you know cook take showers use the bathroom oh my god I mean this is an egregious case if you don't mind Tram can my staff follow up with you offline to just to get more details I know that that's already I mean it's an issue from the past but I think it really helps to highlight why improving the law is necessary absolutely yeah thank you so much Kate Rubin did you want to go ahead yeah thanks for having me the Seattle also works pretty closely with SDCI and SDCI is usually the first thing that we tell a tenant who is experiencing problems in their building that their landlord isn't fixing we're very quick to tell them report them to SDCI and we get pushback a lot from tenants who don't want to upset or offend their landlord especially if they get the run around on getting the inspections like oh yeah I'll get to it or a lot of the smaller mom and pop folks say like they have limited time they have limited funds they'll get to it as soon as they can and the tenants of course have empathy for their landlords too but it's this ongoing problem and it costs a lot of money in the interim if your heat isn't working and your landlord saying I'll get to it soon a lot of people buy a heater if their stove isn't working they'll buy a toaster oven these like unexpected costs really add up and then it's an additional cost to take time off work to let an inspector in and there's no real restitution for living in poor conditions or even just worse conditions than what your lease states that you should be living in so renters often don't report the code violations until they've kind of reached their breaking point and then with the average of 42.3 days from the date of report to date of inspection that's a really long time to live without hot water or without heat or with faulty electricity and so I know SDCI views like they have 100% rate of solving these issues which is fantastic but I think it's not really fair for renters who are dealing with these issues for so long before they have to get SDCI involved and then SDCI doesn't have a lot of power as far as enforcing fines which we saw there were five fines in 2021 but 3,285 complaints that's a lot of people that are suffering with really bad conditions and didn't receive any kind of restitution other than it was done and it could bring them to small claims court but again that's time out of their day that's money that's complicated most tenants are not going to want to go through that and landlords aren't really afraid of code violations like I know if I parked in front of a fire hydrant every day and the person who lived outside of a fire hydrant called and reported me and it took parking enforcement over a month to come out and then they just like warned me and then I had another month or whatever to move my car that's just like not how it works in other areas with code enforcement and that's nothing to say about SDCI's policies other than they need more funding for inspectors and they need to be able to issue some of these fines without the landlords having any fear of them being fined",housing
"There's not really a lot of incentive for them to follow the law to hurry up and get the inspections done in the required amount of time and to keep their units nice they're only getting inspected every few years anyway every five to ten that's a long time a lot of stuff can go wrong and so I think furthering these protections and furthering the enforcement of these is so important to balance the power a little bit and I know the SDCI tries very hard to be impartial but there's already this power imbalance between renters and landlords as landlords are the ones responsible for maintaining a property that's up to certain code standards and so the landlords who seem to be opposed to this and they're saying that they're not getting a voice that not all stakeholders are being invited to the table I disagree because I feel like you knew what you signed up for when you became the city puts out very clear expectations of how the unit needs to be maintained and so you know the laws and If you don't there's tons of resources and the tenant to have to be the one to initiate the complaint process and still receive nothing in return and the landlord to not receive really a punishment for violating the code violation is very frustrating thank you Kate and I just wanted to highlight one thing that you mentioned that you know in 2021 and as the SDCI shared in their presentation there were 3,285 renters rights complaints and as you correctly said that's a lot of renters who are facing dilapidated conditions or a lack of heat or all those things and then on top of that take that into in the context of the fact that probably the majority of renters don't send these complaints in either because they don't know that it'll work they're demoralized or because as tram said they don't even know that this can be done and so the real number of renters who faced some sort of problem of this kind last year is probably far more than that number so it really highlights the scale of the problem so now our speaker is Violet love a dive go ahead Violet I think it looks like we've lost Violet she was logged on before let me check the Violet seems to be to have become disconnected okay so I just wanted to quickly say a few things I know we have one other agenda item which we want to which we need to finish but going back to Jesse the again we've unfortunately all the stories we've heard are egregious to various degrees and so Jesse you mentioned the settlement agreement that our office also looked at that the landlord tried to get the tenants to sign onto and the settlement agreement I believe we attached to the agenda today it says the renter gets a security deposit back which is not like some favor that the landlord is doing that is 100% legally required anyway for the landlord to do it also says the rent this is the look at how egregious the settlement agreement is that it says the renter cannot sue for anything the landlord has to end the lease the day before the fire the renter is essentially waiving their right to relocation assistance and any other damages that otherwise legally entitled to the renter may not talk about what happened or post about it on social media and if they do the landlord can sue the renter the landlord can not try to get renters to sign this essentially by lying to them and saying that they needed to sign in order to get their security deposit back and I think as Jesse explained it's really important that all the tenants of this building including Jesse they got together they understood that this is absolutely the landlord absolutely has no right to do this and that they refuse to sign this document This is a very important example of how when tenants can you know come together and push back collectively that it can work I also think though that all of this that the landlord attempted to be illegal and I don't know if Tram wanted to weigh in on this but I believe that in commercial contracts deceptive practices are illegal but it's not clear to me whether the in residential landlord tenant agreements that what the law is but maybe if you wanted to weigh in on that also and if Jesse if you wanted to say anything more about what happened with you and your fellow tenants well yeah so it was as you said crazy that they had us try and sign these documents especially in the midst of trying to figure out moving getting my stuff out and cleaning my place in general there I was just like I said so much neglect and the worst part was how there was no security in a vacated building the next day like I said they just literally kicked open the doors we have locks but they're keypads I mean obviously that didn't stop the looters and it wasn't even then that the security was put up the next day there were they boarded up the building but the looters just took those off and kicked the doors open again so my place was robbed twice as far as I'm aware but others more than that and then in the meantime trying to figure out I was one of the few that actually had renters insurance thank goodness but to have my insurance come do an adjust or yeah get a claim do the adjustment and get a quote in the meantime still getting robbed like I literally couldn't figure out if I should get my stuff out before these people come because I just kept waiting things or if I had to wait I don't remember specifically I think it's like it was like four days four or five days after they finally had someone on the premises allegedly 24 hours though in our group we we have there have been many of us that have been visiting and discussing whether that person's been there or not which sometimes they are sometimes they're not then they also have fences up but we've seen those fences down there we have documented evidence on that and even those looters they're squatters now let's see what else and then just like the no there was no alarms the whole time I was utterly shocked something I didn't think about in the middle of it all but then once I was outside watching the fire I was utterly just could have died literally could have died and they're still set on all my stuff it's hard to sleep but it's getting better every day anyway it's still pretty traumatic still pretty traumatic for me so yeah thank you thank you Jesse yes I can imagine how traumatic that is and I think you made one one of the important points you made is that there were no alarms for the fire that is extremely concerning this is clearly directly related to the question of housing code compliance and so we should I mean obviously this has already happened but it's something that we should look into did they have that or not and we should also illustrate why we need legally to strengthen Seattle's municipal code in order to make sure that after the fact also landlords can be held liable did you want to make a point sorry I saw your hand up yeah just talking to I had the opportunity to speak with some of Jesse's neighbors and he mentioned that that he had renters insurance which was very helpful and from the talking to his neighbors it sounds like four of the people living in that building did have renters for people that didn't when the fire happened suddenly they needed to find somewhere to somewhere to stay and so four people had renters insurance and were able to use that to find somewhere to stay the majority of people did not stayed with friends family co-workers one person wound up living in their car meanwhile the property owner is holding the security deposits which they have legally the property owner has 21 days to return that security deposit but for the renters trying to find for the people who are displaced trying to find a place to live even if it's legal to hold that security deposit for 21 days it's totally immoral to do that since it will especially since it will need to be legally released anyway people are trying to find somewhere to live they need that money but then that ties back into using that as some sort of bargaining chip to try and get renters to sign away their rights is something that several renters mentioned right thanks so much and obviously there's a lot to follow up on we won't be able to do all of that today so I wanted to thank both the SDCI who just presented and also especially the renters and renters advocates who spoke today some of you renter advocates have been here before on the committee and my office continues to greatly appreciate your participation in these committee meetings because your input is extremely important even if you've been here before your subsequent input is always extremely important so I appreciate you coming here when we request you to and also for all the work that you have been doing Tenants Union and Housing Justice Project in advocating for renters making my office aware of what improvements need to be made for renters rights and also making us aware of specific situations where tenants want to fight back and they want to get organized and that there is somewhere they can provide some political and other assistance so I appreciate all of that and I just wanted in closing I wanted to say one on the case that Ellen Anderson described for their roommates and themselves that there are many instances of landlords both increasing their rent and still not fixing bad conditions as the case that was described with the no water for two years but also in Ellen and their roommates case I just wanted to say renters should not have to accept bad conditions just because their rents are going up either and so either way we do need to really push for increased ability for tenants to fight against bad conditions whether their rents are going up or not and I would just close on the note that Kate Rubin made which is landlords aren't really afraid of cold violations what they will be afraid of is if renters throughout the city got organized demanded to win progressive change like represented by this legislation that we're discussing and also the victories that we won last year and ultimately you know what we really need is rent control citywide strong rent control and we need a massive expansion of publicly owned social housing where you won't have private profit making landlords but it will be something that will belong to everyone and it will be administered by the city council and that doesn't mean that problems will all automatically go away but you will be able to hold a city accountable for all of that and that is going to be extremely important as well",housing
It's unfortunate the rental survey firm Dupre and Scott closed but you know even that firm had gaps in information and it shows that we can't rely on a private survey firm we're a big growing city we should have our own data. So while crafting the original rental housing registration inspection ordinance was challenging at the time several years ago it has been in place for several years. Landlords are already submitting a list of their units.,housing
"I want to thank the landlords of over 30,000 properties already registered with RRIO. Those properties contain about 150,000 units. They are already complying by providing this list of units and they already produce their own list of rental units for their own bookkeeping which include rents type number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms in some cases square footage and the vacancy status.",housing
So in other words RRIO as a vehicle can be an efficient way to have landlords submit their rental rate and occupancy data. We have however received a lot of feedback and concerns about this new bill. I'm open to reasonable amendments as long as there is an undue delay but it was really helpful to have this bill aired today to get that input.,housing
I'm interested in getting complete and accurate housing details before the city council makes major decisions during our comprehensive planning process next year. While we don't yet know which research university the city department would choose to receive and assess this data my office has conferred with the University of Washington's Center for Real Estate Research. They've offered to assemble a brief working group with housing providers to discuss the practical mechanics of posed data collection.,housing
"Its relationship to Rio would be that they would have to submit a certification to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections under the Rio program that they had submitted that data to a research university. The idea would be for a department, either the Office of Planning and Community Development or the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections maybe even the Office of Housing to hold a contract with that research university that would detail all of the scope of information that the city is requesting for analysis using the data that the property owners would submit to the university. As the bill is currently drafted, the intent is for a property owner to submit information about February of every year to the university by March 31st of that year.",housing
"The number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Information that reflects the net monthly residential rent and if utilities are included in rent, what that amount is. And the length of a rental agreement.",housing
"We need to know that for many reasons. Because the SDCI Rental Registration and Inspection Ordinance Annual Report that council received on August 5th but was about reporting on 2020 notes that by the end of the year, total registrations into the program decreased by 14.4% from 2019. That's over the course of a year.",housing
But the total number of units stayed relatively stable with only a 0.65% decrease. The difference between units and actual renewals of properties indicates that the apartments or the units that were already built stayed in the system and were counted. They did not decrease.,housing
"But the fact that the actual properties that we're talking about, the renewals in the program indicates to me that it's the small mom-and-pop landlords that are basically not taking their properties off the market. I looked at the 2018 University of Washington study. It was the Seattle Rental Housing Study Final Report published in June of 2018.",housing
It surveys landlords and one line caught my attention which is basically that it notes landlords' frustration with the first-in-time and other laws that council had passed. It basically says about 40% of landlords have sold or planned to sell property in response to city ordinances governing the housing market. That was so in three years since then and there have been more recent regulations.,housing
"I think that we do need to document this. My interest is in making sure that we aren't driving small landlords out of the market because when they take their properties off the market or they sell their property there, it's redeveloped for market rate rent oftentimes or just for owner occupancy. I understand that your timeline is based around upcoming zoning decisions that are going to be made.",housing
"When I was reading this report, it mentioned I know that Dupree and Scott closing their office has been a big detriment to us getting this information. We're all on the same page about that. It mentions the Runstat Center.",housing
"The reality is that property values are skyrocketing. Are landlords selling because they do not want to comply with the first-in-time law, or are they selling because property values have gone through the roof and they can cash in on their property like never before? It's totally their right, and if they're selling their property, it's not appropriate.",housing
"I have no doubt that there are many landlords who don't like the increased renters' rights, but this is not about what they like or don't like. It is about having a city that actually has a bare minimum standard, let alone anything better, but bare minimum standards for how renters are treated, and we're not there yet. I don't think anybody can claim that Seattle has too much of renters' rights, other than landlords.",housing
"As we know, unfortunately, Seattle's Democratic establishment, starting with Mayor Harrell, recently decided to end the city's pandemic eviction moratorium. When my office brought forward the legislation to extend the moratorium till the end of the official declaration of the emergency, only Council Members Herbold, Mosqueda, and myself voted in favor of it. Today, Seattle's ordinance creating a defense against eviction for the six months following the end of the COVID emergency was unfortunately struck down in court because the law is means-tested, requiring renters to self-certify that they support financial hardship during the emergency, and the judge said that the landlord did not have a way to challenge those self-certifications.",housing
"In my mind, and as I have said repeatedly, these renter rights should never have been means-tested at all. I have not had a chance to discuss with the City Attorney's Office yet because this just happened today. Maybe they are planning to appeal.",housing
"However, if that is not the case, then my office has asked City Council Central staff earlier today to prepare legislation to correct any legal challenge preferably by removing the means-testing from this law. Last Friday, the Sustainability and Renters' Rights Committee continued to discuss situations when landlords have violated housing codes and renter rights and the difficulties renters and renter advocates had getting justice. Seattle Department of Construction Inspections, commonly referred to be by its initials SDCI, presented at the committee about how they investigate and enforce renters' rights and what powers they have and do not have to intervene when a renter calls their hotline.",housing
"Then we heard from a panel of renters and renter advocates about their experiences when their rights were violated and their attempts to get justice. My office is regularly contacted by renters who are having their rights violated. Sometimes their landlord has broken the law, and other times they are subjected to conditions that are unacceptable but not illegal, such as outrageously high rent increases.",housing
"However, we have also found that far too often renters cannot get justice even when their landlords have broken the law. By working with renters over the years and discussing the city's enforcement procedures with experts at the Housing Justice Project and at the SDCI, my office is gathering examples where the city's enforcement procedures need to improve. We intend to develop legislation out of these committee meetings to overhaul how renters' rights are enforced in our city.",housing
"I understand now that their tasting room has moved to a brick and mortar location in Ballard. So prior to the interim controls, how did the City regulate home occupations? The City of Seattle has a sort of relatively permissive regulatory regime for home occupations.",housing
"Property manager to. Rent up to people who have represent the characteristics of folks who traditionally lived in the community and have been pushed out. Similarly, the city council has done some work. With the city of Seattle.",housing
To adopt the Seattle ordinance. Sort of Seattle's version of a notice of right. First refusal.,housing
"Due to the prolific use of racial discrimination in the city, Mr. Norman was forced to leave the city in 1968. Mr. Norman was black, and it was common for owners to deny the purchase or rental of property to people who were black, Asian, or Jewish, up to and even after the passage of the Civil Rights and Fair Housing Act of 1968. According to Mr. Norman's son, Lawrence, his father broke through this city in the 1960s, both inside and outside of redlined neighborhoods.",housing
"Council member Strauss aligning the payment plans for renters behind on rent. To the schedule established by state law last year. To be clear, the state law should apply, apply regardless, but aligning the city timeline will.",housing
Your dishwasher is broke. Call up somebody that is going to fix it for $200. The whole calculation is meaningless here.,housing
"Then in 2021, renter organizers won Senate Bill 5160 in Washington State, which included a similar payment plan for unpaid back rent, but in that case, the payment plan was for payments up to a third of a month's rent each month, which could go longer than six months for renters more than two months behind on rent. The bill we are voting on today aligns the city of Seattle's payment plan timeline with the state timeline, which will help avoid confusion. The state timeline is legally the timeline that applies anyway, so for most renters and landlords, this will not make a substantive change.",housing
"The one exception being back rent accrued in the six months following the end of the emergency is only covered by the city law, not the state law, so the change timeline would have an impact on how rent owed for those months would be paid off. Because this is an overwhelmingly just a bill to clarify the existing laws that apply, I believe we can vote it out of committee today, and we'll have a discussion soon. Next on today's agenda are appointments to the city of Seattle Renters Commission.",housing
"There wasn't an anticipation that there would be substantially multiple years of rent being accrued, so this would conform with the one-third that's already been discussed as what the state has put into place. For the second line, you see that the ordinance you see that the tenant can, what in the original legislation that is currently adopted, the tenant can propose an alternative plan. The proposed ordinance would have, use the language, a reasonable schedule.",housing
"So if the mayor and the governor did not rescind their orders at the same time, there would be potentially, for example, if Mayor Harreld took two months longer to rescind the state of emergency, tenants would already have two months longer because of the way that the new bill ties to the city's action, and would have six additional months as well, because the proposed legislation is not only the end of the civil emergency, but also six months afterwards. If the mayor and the governor were in lockstep and rescinded their orders at the same time, under this proposal, rent covered for six months after the termination of those orders would still be captured under the repayment plan if Council Bill 120305 were adopted. With that, I'll turn it over to questions from the Council Members.",housing
"So I'm hoping to work on things that will increase the availability of affordable housing, perhaps income-based housing, which seems like a very fair system. I think my background as an attorney gives me some lens through which to view that. And I think that also one of the emphases that I would like to work on is making sure that the laws that the council passes have enforcement mechanisms in them so that renters who are faced with difficult situations don't then have to take on the further burden of finding an attorney or another person who can speak for them and help them, but instead can point to an article in the law that gives them that agency already.",housing
"And some of them actually originated the recommendation. Some of them originated from the renters commission, like the winter eviction ban was something that the renters commission really advocated for. And also the six month notice for renters, before any rent increase can happen, all of that, the renters commission played an integral role in that.",housing
"One of the things that we've already been discussing and we're going to be more specific once we can hone in on particular pieces of legislation, anti-retaliation measures, akin to those in civil rights laws that will serve as a basis, sword and shield for renters in the future. After we heard from Department of Construction and Inspection and realized how few people they have in this city to respond to complaints of, the spectrum of problems faced by tenants, it becomes clear that there need to be some more self-enforcement and some more protections for renters who do speak up because help may be a while in coming. So I just see a need for, I guess, a bigger stick.",housing
"And yes, I completely agree that there should be very strong anti-retaliatory language. I mean, we have that language for workers' rights and obviously that it's only as strong as it's enforcement. So we need to enforce those rights, but also for tenants, the starting point is having those laws on the books and then we have to make sure that those laws are enforced because yes, intimidation and threats by landlord against tenants speaking up is unfortunately, yeah, not an unheard of occurrence.",housing
"I think one thing that has come up for me as a renter in Seattle is kind of what Kim spoke to is both the enforcement, but also, I hear a lot of talk about we need to make sure that mom and pop landlords are being helped out and certainly they need to be able to make sure they've got a roof over their head. But one of the things that I've noticed is that a lot of our laws seem to give a lot of really strong enforcement for larger entities, corporate entities, and tend to get a lot more relaxed and I would say lenient when it comes to smaller operations. Based on having mostly rented from what you would call mom and pop establishments in the city, I would note that it is those areas where the enforcement is either divergent between larger rental companies or mom and pop outfits.",housing
"Those are areas where the latter will oftentimes take advantage of renters and really, really not live up to the spirit of the law while adhering to the letter of it. And that's something I would really love to hopefully see reviewed and looked at. Anyone else want to add anything?",housing
And so. What do you think about rent control? I think it's great.,housing
"And I think too, obviously we need to keep working on strengthening the renter's rights law in many different ways. I hope you all know the kinds of laws we were able to initiate through the work of renter organizing, through my office, through socialists fighting for union members where I've been part of it. And we won a whole series of victories last year, but we need to win more this year.",housing
"And crisis is acute for renters and working people. But in addition to all of those other things that we're doing, including the six month notice, the economic evictions assistance ordinance, which actually mandates that landlords should pay three months rent when they end up displacing a tenant due to an exorbitant rent increase. But in addition to all of that, we do need the sort of the overarching policy changes that will actually like make a decisive shift in the misery that renters face.",housing
"All of this, I think absolutely needs citywide rent control. And I would appeal to you all, if you all could look at the rent control legislation that my office has drafted, we would love your feedback. But just in a nutshell, what that bill does, if it is passed is if the, it would go into effect as soon as the state lifted, it's a completely unjust more than 40 year old ban on rent control for cities to pass rent control.",housing
"But if the ban were lifted, then the rent control that we are recommending is extremely strong. Basically it says that every rental home, no matter what it is, if you're renting in a group house or a condo, or as Sarah mentioned, student housing, if you're a student near UW and you're renting in student housing, it doesn't matter what type of rental home it is, you should be covered under rent control and it should be, it should have vacancy control, meaning it should not be allowed to go up dramatically again and it should remain under rent control regardless of tenants moving in and out. And it should be citywide and it should cover all buildings regardless of when the buildings were built.",housing
"And as you, I'm sure you all know, because you have some expertise on renters, right? You know that in other cities where they have one rent control, the corporate landlord lobby ended up fighting against it. And they've introduced loopholes of various kinds that makes the rent control function not well.",housing
"And then they use those loopholes to say, look, rent control doesn't work. It doesn't cover all renters. And so it needs to be abolished.",housing
"And I thought Shahr brought up a very, very important point about how there is this whole idea created, like, well, it's mom and pop landlords and then we should be protecting mom and pop landlords, as if that's a goal in itself. The goal is to make life livable for the vast majority of people. And so by that measure, nobody should be allowed to exploit anyone else.",housing
"So whether you're a small business or you're Amazon, you should not be exploiting your employees. Similarly, whether you're a small landlord or a big landlord, you should not be allowed to exploit renters. And so I really appreciate, Shahr, the point you brought up that, well, the law should be enforced no matter which landlords are doing it.",housing
"And I think it's a very important point that a lot of there are good landlords, but we cannot have laws that rely on some people doing good things, whereas the norm for renters being that they're being exploited. I would really recommend, if people haven't read the book by Matthew Desmond, which is called Evicted, Poverty and Profit in the American City, which is a brilliant exposition of how there are so many landlords, including small landlords, who, whether or not they may be good or whatever people in their personal lives, end up playing this role in the rental market, playing an absolutely just devastating and exploitative role towards renters. And that's why the laws have to be written in such a way and enforced in such a way that they protect renters who are being exploited.",housing
"Furthermore, there's also the problem that a lot of slumlords and even big corporations, like Windermere and so on, they divide themselves into small LLCs, where the individual company might be small, but overall, it is actually a massive corporation that is exploiting renters. So I think that all of that needs to be taken into consideration. And my office has repeatedly made those points that we need to keep that into account.",housing
"And the last point I'll make before we call for a vote, unless there are any other questions, is in response to what Council Member Nelson said, I mean, there's this repeated assertion that's being made by the landlord lobby that small landlords are leaving the housing market. And the implication, although it's often not said explicitly, the underlying, whatever, sort of the coded language is that renters' rights are driving small landlords out of the market, and that's why we need to give consideration to landlords. I want to be very clear, and I've said this before, but I'll say it again in this committee.",housing
"Property values are skyrocketing. So the question is, are landlords selling because they do not want to comply with the first-in-time law, or are they selling because property values have gone through the roof and they can cash in on their property like never before? I mean, all of that needs to be examined.",housing
"If a landlord is not willing to respect renters' rights and sells the property as a result, then they probably should not have been a landlord anyway. And the bottom line is, if you're a landlord who is not exploiting renters, your tenants, then the laws don't even affect you. Even rent control actually won't affect you as a landlord if you're not gouging your tenants with high rents.",housing
"So if you're a good landlord, then you should actually be supporting. And we do have good landlords who do support renters' rights. Some of them have spoken up in public comment as well.",housing
"Data is important. And the best data we have right now, unfortunately, is the 2018 UW study, which includes interviews with landlords and tenants. And both sides talk about their struggles.",housing
"And so the reasons that many small landlords are struggling are talked about there, their top reasons. It's not simply because they can make a lot more money selling their properties. It's because they do go into specifics about the things that they're concerned about.",housing
"And I apologize you had to wait. My office first heard your story, as I said, this past Wednesday. But it is something that is happening to renters all over the city.",housing
"Hopefully, we can save your homes. And other renters around the city can be inspired by your example. And like you, we'll get organized into Renters Association.",housing
"I mean, the thing that I was reminded of immediately was we had a press conference last September to unveil our rent control legislation, which I really urge you all to look at as well. We had a speaker who was a doctoral student at the University of Washington. And he spoke as part of the press conference.",housing
"I think that is itself a testament to why we should absolutely be saving your tenancy in this building. And I wanted to assure you from my office, as you know from our track record of winning renters' rights victories, we will absolutely be on your side. We have to really fight to make sure that a nonprofit organization can buy the building.",housing
"So that's kind of the thing that happened that has caused this, caused the situation right now. And just I think that the points that came up here were the points that were also discussed at the excellent meeting organized by the tenants union on Wednesday, which I was able to attend. And I was glad to be able to do that because I it is really oppressive how this group of renters are organizing it to a tenants association already, which is the first step.",housing
"And also, we need rent control as well, but we need both. We need both rent control to make sure that rental homes that are owned by private corporations or by private landlords don't exploit renters. But we also need an expansion of publicly owned housing that are not at the whims of some private owner either.",housing
"And the conditions are absolutely deplorable. So in other words, tenant organizing is going to be crucial no matter who your owner is because you need to be organized for different kinds of rights. Obviously, right now, you're fighting to just maintain your tenancy there.",housing
"So I'm interested in working on the Seattle Renters Commission for a few reasons. I'm a six-year Seattle renter. I went to UW, studied public health and human rights, went on a travel fellowship, and came back, started working as a social worker with the LEAD program, which works with homeless folks in Capitol Hill and downtown.",housing
It also requires that any payment is not more than one third of a renter's rent for that month. This modest bill is essentially a technical correction as it is mirroring the language from the state bill. And my bill before you tomorrow brings our city code in line with our state law to diminish confusion and ensure the city law and state law are the same.,housing
"My name is Gordon Haggerty, and I'm addressing CB120305, the rent repayment plan revisions. I want to thank you, members of the City Council, for this opportunity to address you today, and I look forward to the opportunity hopefully soon when we can meet again face-to-face. I've been a builder and an affordable housing provider in Seattle for over 50 years, and over that time, I've been watching the regulatory burden for housing providers steadily increase, becoming more adversarial and downright hostile at times to small providers like myself, while watching affordability become nothing more than a catchphrase.",housing
"While the aim of CB120305 is to revise the current city plan to align with the state plan, changing the timing from the ending of the state's emergency declaration to six months after the city's declaration creates not only confusion but also additional hardship on local mom-and-pop housing providers like myself. Regardless of your best intentions, Seattle is currently hemorrhaging rental housing units. As you know, Seattle's rental registration rolls have dropped by almost 10,000 units between May 1, 2021, and January 1, 2022.",housing
"That's 10,000 rental units gone from Seattle in just seven months. About 12.7 percent of those are single-family units, most likely converting from rental to owner-occupied. The remainder, duplex and more, when sold likely go to developers who demolish the older affordable housing stock and replace with denser, more expensive, and more profitable units.",housing
Small mom-and-pop housing providers like myself are being forced to get out. Thank you. Our next speaker is Daniel Bannon.,housing
"Hello. My name is Daniel Bannon, speaking on behalf of the Rental Housing Association of Washington. We represent over 5,000 small housing providers across the state, many of which are from Seattle.",housing
"I'm here today to urge you to amend CB120305. We are supportive of bringing city regulations in line with state laws, as this will give housing providers clarity on which rules apply. This ordinance references the requirement for repayment plans, but it ties the city repayment plan to the city emergency, not the state emergency.",housing
"This is unnecessary, confusing, and will leave Seattle housing providers guessing which state or city laws apply to them, making it more difficult to ensure they are fully in compliance with city and state law. RHA urges the council to amend the proposed ordinance to sunset along with the state's state of emergency, proclaimed by Governor's Proclamation 20-05. The state already provides ample protections for tenants facing ongoing financial difficulties resulting from the COVID pandemic, including the state-wide requirement for a payment plan that already applies to Seattle.",housing
"We must prevent further isolation of Seattle's rental housing policy that is forcing small housing providers out of the city at unprecedented rates, as seen in your RRIO data. We would like to see future housing policy have a more robust stakeholder process where all voices are heard. We urge you to amend the proposed ordinance to sunset along with the state's state of emergency, proclaimed by Governor's Proclamation 20-05.",housing
There's a plethora of timely data available in the city pertaining to a vast number of important issues. But it seems the city council is not interested in listening to timely SDCI data from the RIO database that tracks the number of available rental units. This legislation will just escalate the decline of affordable rental housing as the small landlords continue to flee the market.,housing
"I'm a small landlord in Seattle. I also live in Seattle, and I'm calling with regard to Council Bill 120-305. It's very disturbing to me that the city is switching the laws around.",housing
"Following the state law for tenant repayment should be what is followed, not having something that's separate. Extending the time frame is confusing for the repayment program. The state legislature clearly defined the time period where these measures are needed.",housing
"Constantly changing requirements for housing providers is driving out small mom-and-pop landlords like me. We're the best low-cost housing providers in the city, and this is a real problem. The goal should be to encourage mom-and-pop landlords, people who are attentive to their tenants, and keep the rents relatively low by comparison to new and what's often new replacement modern construction.",housing
"So I have to say thank you very much for bringing this forward because I do believe that clarity in repayment plans is necessary. And I will admit that I missed the conversation in the sustainability and renters rights committee, and that's on me. However, this legislation was heard in committee only a couple of days after introduction, and we only had one meeting to discuss and vote.",housing
"But regardless, what's important to me is that landlords had the ability to weigh in on this before we discussed it, and I'm told that that was not the case. But basically, this bill is characterized as a technical fix to bring us into alignment with state statute. And, you know, digging into this since then, I've learned that it's not quite in perfect alignment, and it would likely lengthen the time, the arrears specified in the repayment plans, longer than the state statute provides for.",housing
"So ours has gone on much longer than that, and this would cover arrears that are incurred during the six-month period after the end of the civil emergency or after the end of the eviction moratorium. There is much more detail in here, but the bottom line is that I am concerned about losing rental housing stock, particularly that of small landlords who have less resources to weather the eviction moratorium and unpaid rent that is ongoing. And so we require them to keep their properties in good condition for their renters, and I'm just concerned about prolonging the time that these small landlords will have to get that money to maintain their properties and add additional uncertainty about when that might happen.",housing
"You may recall an article in the Seattle Times a couple months back that featured a worker who was fearing the end of the eviction moratorium. They were urgently working to wrestle up money to pay the rent and to stay housed. They are a good worker, and their story is not unique.",housing
"Because the bills impact both city light and SPU, I'm cosponsoring them with councilmember Nelson. The bill will also amend the rental housing registration inspection ordinance, RRIO, for short. The bill to accomplish this was originally council bill 120284.",housing
"That was heard for the first time in the renter's rights committee on March 18. Since that first discussion, we made a few rounds of technical and implementation changes. Based on those changes, we were advised to update the title of the bill.",housing
"You can also find that bill on the city's Legistar website. Council bill 120325 will be heard this Friday, May 20, at the renter's rights committee. If you have any questions about the bill, you can contact my office.",housing
"Council Member Morales. Yes, thank you. I move to amend the introduction and referral calendar to introduce a bill entitled an ordinance relating to just cause eviction, changing the terms of certain eviction defenses and amending section 22.205.090 and 22.205.100 of the Seattle Municipal Code and referring it to the Sustainability and Renters' Rights Committee.",housing
"So this is a bill, as we said, that would amend the six-month eviction defense ordinance. And the reason that we are, Council Member Sawant is not able to be here today, so I'm doing this on her behalf. And we are trying to walk the bill on to today's IRC calendar rather than wait for next week, mostly because of the need to have the Council bill require 30 days after signature by the mayor to go into effect.",housing
"Councilmember Peterson also has an amendment to that bill to clarify how it will be enforced. Next, the committee will discuss and vote on a bill sponsored by my office in response to a court of appeals decision that objected to one small part of Seattle's six-month eviction defense. That ordinance requires renters to attest that they have suffered financial hardship in order to be eligible to use that defense against eviction, and the court of appeals objected to the mechanics of that attestation, specifically that there is not language giving landlords the ability to rebut the claim that renters face financial hardship.",housing
"I want to be clear that the six-month eviction defense is still in effect because the city has appealed the court of appeals decision. However, out of an abundance of caution and particularly to avoid confusion, my office is sponsoring this bill to respond to the court of appeals concerns. There are two ways to address the court of appeals decision.",housing
"The city council could add a line explaining how landlords can rebut renters' claims on financial hardship, or the council could simply remove the requirement that renters have faced financial hardship, you know, the requirement that renters have to claim that so that there is no claim to rebut. As I have argued repeatedly in the past, I strongly prefer that we have no elements of means testing, however minor, in renters' rights legislation, and so I strongly prefer the second option. It should be a given that if a renter is in an eviction court, they have suffered financial hardship because nobody in their right mind would be in an eviction court out of choice, and that simply doesn't happen.",housing
"Why else would they be there other than if they had financial hardship? So requiring that they declare financial hardship, particularly if their landlords start challenging those claims, drags renters through a humiliating process that in reality has a chilling effect, preventing the very people this eviction defense was intended to help in the first place from using it, and in fact there is a lot of documentary evidence to show how the court process overwhelmingly is imbalanced towards protecting landlords just because they feel, you know, landlords are much more equipped and much more experienced in dealing with legal processes. My office has discussed with the Housing Justice Project who defend renters in eviction court, and in reality this eviction defense is rarely needed right now because both renters and landlords usually prefer a different eviction defense that is connected to rental assistance funds to pay off back rent, but those programs are currently only funded to the end of June.",housing
"Hopefully they will be extended, but in the meantime this bill will clarify the next line of defense for renters. Because legislation requires 30 days after signature by the mayor to go into effect, if this bill is passed I intend to move to suspend the rules to have it appear on Tuesday next week's city council agenda rather than the following week as would typically happen for legislation voted out of a Friday committee. As I said, there are two ways that this bill could have responded to the Court of Appeals concern.",housing
"The bill I have proposed responds by eliminating the need for a need for any means test by the renter. I understand Council Member Mosqueda has prepared an amendment to instead use the other approach, adding a line about how landlords can rebut renters at the stations. Our final agenda item today is a report from the Office of Sustainability and Environment on their work in the recent social justice report.",housing
"This is Candace Chevalier. I would like to urge you to vote no on Council Bill 120330 and 120325. I want to mention, I actually represent a lot of apartment owners in the sale of their buildings and I can see how these regulations really affect their decisions to sell versus continue to own the property.",housing
"First of all, the first one that eliminates the need for a tenant to show need to a financial need to avoid paying rent just doesn't make any sense really. It's much better to have them if the tenant can't pay, they should be able to claim I can't pay and this is why. And if a landlord can rebut that, if a landlord can rebut that successfully, that's good.",housing
That's what a judge is for. The problem with this is that it opens up what it basically means is that tenants no longer need to pay rent to avoid the act of eviction. The other bill also presents a problem with this recording.,housing
"These are the kinds of things that are driving small landlords like me out of Seattle and this is a real problem because we provide the low. Marilyn Yim followed by Tram Tran-Larsen and then Kate Martin. Go ahead, Marilyn.",housing
"Good morning. I'm speaking in opposition to the two Council Bills before you today. In January 2020, OPCD's housing choices report found that two-thirds of renters prefer renting one to four unit properties and three-quarters of respondents want city policy to encourage more of these options.",housing
"Yet since then, the city has lost 11% of its rental housing, 94% of which is those very same properties that the majority of renters prefer. That same report cautioned against the kind of data gathering that Council Bill 120325 proposes. This shows a real disconnect between the city's policies and actual outcomes for both renters and small mom and pop providers.",housing
"City Council actions such as those considered today are driving out the very properties that most city residents want more of and you're not collecting data to figure out why this is happening. Now you want to suspend rental payments indefinitely with no additional rental assistance when there are housing providers owed $50,000 to $100,000 right now. We keep trying to tell you why mom and pops are suffering because of harsh legislation, yet you keep ignoring and alienating us with today being the latest example.",housing
"Hi. I just wanted to call in and express the fact that I am considered a small landlord here and I do have two properties that recently became vacant, and just the idea of extending this moratorium puts me in a position where I will probably be choosing to sell my property as opposed to renting them out again because I cannot afford to not receive rental or rent from my tenants. So I hope that you do consider how this affects small landlords and small property owners.",housing
"My name is Tram Tran-Larsen, and I'm the Community Engagement Manager at the Housing Justice Project. On behalf of HJP, we support council members to launch a proposed ordinance to amend the language in the COVID-related defense to eviction to address the issue raised by the Court of Appeals. This is a relatively minor fix.",housing
Thank you. I'd like to just make a few comments to my opposition to extending the moratorium on evictions. I'm a small landlord running a shared house that I own.,housing
"Go ahead, Gordon. Hello. This is Gordon Haggarty, and I've been a small housing provider for over 50 years now.",housing
"I've had great success with tenant relations and have not had to do evictions. We've been able to work this out, but what you are doing, and I'm speaking in opposition to both of these council bills, and I'll send written comments in more detail, too, but I just have to say I'm strongly opposed and concerned to both of these. It's adding extra burdens on housing providers.",housing
Thank you. My name is Kay Fon. I've been a small landlord for 15 years.,housing
"I wanted to say, City Council, thank you for hearing my comments. I'm speaking out against CD 120330, an ordinance relating to just cause eviction, changing the terms of certain eviction defenses and amending sections 22.205.090, et cetera, of the Seattle Municipal Code. In REJ versus Seattle, the city was found negligent in providing due process to landlords because it didn't allow landlords to test the veracity of attendance, self-certification of hardship.",housing
"The city has appealed the decision and is now challenging the decision by fast-tracking this legislation through a vote. I acknowledge that the eviction process is hard on both tenants and landlords. This is the key, acknowledging both parties.",housing
"Both parties have responsibilities to maintain housing. The landlord must provide a safe, kept unit that is in good working order. The tenant- Angie Gerald, go ahead.",housing
"Council funded a small landlord stakeholder group, which SDCI has not been able to implement yet. Council also funded a new rental housing study, which has not begun to happen yet. You're developing policies in an echo chamber.",housing

"My name is Daniel Bannon, calling in on behalf of the Rental Housing Association of Washington. We represent over 5,000 small housing providers across the state, many of which are in Seattle. I'm here today to urge you to vote no on both CB120325 and CB120330.",housing
CB120325 puts an unnecessary burden on every housing provider in the city to provide private information to the city. Mandatory participation has already been shown to result in inaccurate and unreliable data. Mandating housing providers provide their private information to a third party as part of RIO with unknown certification and management procedures only adds unnecessary costs to housing providers while the city claims to care about affordable housing.,housing
"We're also joined by Asha Venkatraman from Council Central Staff. Council Bill 120325, an ordinance relating to housing and displacement mitigation, expanding the information required for submission under the rental registration inspection ordinance for rental housing units, requiring submission of rental housing related information and amending chapter 22.214 of the Seattle Municipal Code. Council Member Peterson, welcome.",housing
"Thank you, Chair Sawant. Thank you for having me here as a guest to the Renter's Rights Committee to discuss this bill, which is Council Bill 120325. I was back at your committee in March discussing a substantially similar bill and Central Staff will discuss today the couple of changes that have been made since then, but hopefully this has given folks a lot of time to think about this bill and the need for additional information.",housing
"It would, I believe, efficiently fill the long-standing gap in data for Seattle's rental housing inventory so that we finally get the detailed information we need for well-informed policymaking about affordable housing. Seattle's rental housing registration and inspection ordinance adopted several years ago, as we know, already requires landlords to submit a list of their rental units and this bill would simply have property owners include that list along with rental rates, square footage, vacancy information to a research university to compile and analyze this important data. No personal information would be provided over the past several years.",housing
"So Council Bill 120284, and generally conceptually the intent of both that bill and Council Bill 120325, which is in front of you today, would require landlords to submit rent and rental housing information to a research university and to certify to the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections that it had done so through a certification through the rental registration and inspection ordinance existing process. It contemplates that an executive department, so either SDCI, the Office of Planning and Community Development, or OPCD, or the Office of Housing, as the most likely candidates would contract with the research university, to have this information analyzed and then get analysis back to the city about displacement risks and the rental market, the rental housing market. So between the time we discussed Council Bill 120284 and today, a couple changes to the bill were incorporated, some of which required a title change, which is why there's a new council bill in front of you.",housing
"These penalties were modeled after the rental agreement regulations that are in Chapter 7.24 that seemed more appropriate for violations of reporting. The RIO scheme is, my understanding is that it's intended to deal with if there are things like housing code violations, things that are continuing for a long period of time when it comes to people's housing quality. And so making that change would put these reporting requirements in line with the rental agreement regulation requirements in Chapter 7.",housing
"So I want to know, that's important for us to know as we're going forward with any kind of decisions around landlord-tenant issues, and also if we want to figure out what is really happening with this disappearance of those units or those properties from the list. But anyway, I am concerned, however, that this legislation places an additional burden on small landlords because the stated purpose or the goal from the sponsor, Council Member Peterson, is to help us make land use decisions during the comp plan amendment process in 2024. And so I think that using, you know, burdening small landlords in order to get to that goal is unnecessary.",housing
"In case people weren't following the previous iterations, I think that we should just let folks know that this council bill would provide, would require landlords to produce information about the net rentables, rentable square footage, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the information sufficient to ascertain the total net monthly residential rent charged, including but not limited to total monthly residential rent being charged or to be charged if vacant, as well as the amount and identity of utilities paid by the owner, including the rent charge and if subject to a rental agreement, the current length of the term of the rental agreement. Well, you know, there was a background memo basically saying that landlords typically produce rent rolls on a monthly basis for their own internal bookkeeping to monitor and fill vacancies and to determine rental revenue for management and tax purposes, but most small landlords actually don't do this. I mean, they don't have to put down that much information and usually they're, you know, they record their revenue on their tax forms once a year.",housing
"And this claim seems to be from landlords that they provide low rent housing and that is why they refuse to disclose the rent, but we should just trust them because it's low. Well, that's not acceptable. And landlord and council member Nelson both call this a burden.",housing
"I mean, it's completely speculative, this claim that renter's rights are more reporting or increased protection for renters is driving small landlords out of the market. That's complete speculation. Property values are skyrocketing.",housing
"That's something that's been well-documented. So, the question really is, are these landlords who they claim to be selling, I mean, if they're selling, are they selling because they don't want to comply with basic laws? Are they selling because property values have gone through the roof and they can cash in on their property like never before?",housing
"It's just a specious claim to say that regulatory burden is making that or reporting requirements is making you do that. We should also make sure to mention that a lot of corporate entities are divided up into small LLCs and each of these LLCs then claims to be representing a small landlord interest. I think that also is a factor here when people are speaking, are they actually small landlords?",housing
"Who are the small landlords who are speaking up? And we've seen people from corporations like Windermere speak as representatives of small landlords as well. So, I think those points have to be noted.",housing
"The next agenda item is the legislation from my office amending the six-month eviction defense in response to a recent decision by the Court of Appeals. I will read the bill into the record now. Council Bill 120330, an ordinance relating to just cause evictions, changing the terms of certain eviction defenses and amending Sections 22.205.090 and 22.205100 of the Seattle Municipal Code.",housing
"Asha Venkatraman, Council Central staff. The bill in front of you, Council Bill 120330, amends Seattle Municipal Code Sections 22.205.090 and 100. 090 is a defense put into place several years ago that would allow a tenant to assert the defense during the eviction moratorium and six months after the eviction moratorium expired. That is, in fact, because the moratorium, the city moratorium expired at the end of February, the defense would be in effect up through the end of August.",housing
"As has been discussed, this defense was challenged and was in litigation in RHA versus Seattle. The Court of Appeals issued its decision on the procedural due process part of this legislation and ruled that it needed to be more clear that a landlord has the opportunity to rebut a assertion of financial hardship that a tenant was self-certifying at the time. In response, this piece of legislation removed the requirement to prove financial hardship from both 22.205.090 as well as 100.",housing
"And so, rather, and as Council Member Salas discussed earlier in the committee meeting, rather than add the ability for a landlord to rebut the assertion of financial hardship, removes the requirement to prove financial hardship altogether. That is the crux of the changes that this bill would make. Because of the, let me back up.",housing
"At the moment, the Housing Justice Project, who provides advocacy for tenants in court against eviction, has been using the rental assistance that is under contract through the county that is available to them to use for tenants. That contract is expected to end on June 30th, and it's not clear whether there will be any extension or if there are any actual rental assistance funds left. The Housing Justice Project does not administer any of the City's rental assistance funds, though it does have a contract with the City to advocate for tenants in general.",housing
"Because of the expiration of that contract on June 30th, the ability of the attorneys to use rental assistance in trying to decrease the likelihood of eviction for tenants ends, leaving this defense in effect essentially for July and August. Due to the practicality of using the defense without making the change that is contemplated either in this bill or the amendment to this bill, the eviction defense attorneys are less likely to be able to assert the defense, which is the reason for this bill moving forward. If it passes out of committee today with the suspension of the rules, it can go in front of the full council for consideration this coming Tuesday, which would allow the mayor a sufficient amount of time to sign, if he so chooses, to have it be in effect by June 30th.",housing
"And I say unnecessarily because it's supposedly being driven by the June 30th termination of the county's contract with the Housing Justice Project, but that contract's going to end anyway because that's when the state's rental assistance funding will end. So, the end of that contract is, to me, immaterial to this defense. And moreover, SDCI also has an ongoing contract with HDP, I believe, and their advocates and tenants advocating for themselves can still avail themselves of this defense regardless of the June 30th contract expiration.",housing
"So, this defense is still on the books during the City's appeal of the ruling in RHA's favor, which found the defense unconstitutional for denying landlords the due process to challenge the tenant's self-certification of inability to pay rent. And that's why I voted against walking this on because I understood that the June 30th date was irrelevant to the continued use of this defense while our motion for reconsideration is still pending. And also because it's my understanding that taking legislative action to amend the six-month defense to fix the deficit identified by the Court of Appeals would likely moot any effort by the City to appeal to the Court of Appeals' decision to the Washington Supreme Court in hopes of obtaining a more favorable statement of due process law.",housing
"And the stakes are pretty high here because the Court's decision on that claim, I understand, you know, could impact future legislative efforts in this realm. So, in other words, fixing the defense, I believe, could impact our current motion of reconsideration in a negative way. Nevertheless, we were presented with two options for fixing the six-month defense should we decide to go that route anyway.",housing
And we were strongly advised in favor of the option that retains the requirement for tenant self-certification of financial hardship but makes clear that the landlord has the opportunity to rebut the tenant's showing. And that's what my amendment does if we discuss that. It resolves the defect identified by the Court of Appeals without inviting the argument that not requiring the tenant to demonstrate hardship constitutes an independent defect.,housing
"The other option of removing the requirement for showing of hardship, which this legislation does, increases legal risk that the six-month defense will be, you know, successfully challenged and begs the question, why don't we just extend protections to all tenants regardless of the ability to pay? And so, it basically guts the rationale of the six-month defense. And there's already a paper trail showing why we put the hardship requirement in there anyway, because of contract clause concerns.",housing
"So, instead of fixing the defense and protecting ourselves against claims that we're denying landlords due process, we're doubling down and taking a far riskier path of exposing the city to potential, you know, contract clause violation suits. And I just don't see why we would do that. Asha, go ahead.",housing
"And so, the contract ending on June 30th with the county is the end of that, the rental assistance piece being available. The only other thing I wanted to clarify is that some of the reason for making these changes is the understanding that we have from the eviction defense attorneys, that without the use of rental assistance, the ability to use this defense without making a legislative fix could be compromised, since judges may be likely to look at the Court of Appeals decision as persuasive, even though it's technically not final and binding. So, judges could be making their own decisions about how the existing law violates procedural due process.",housing
"And I was just going to add to what you said, Asha, that on the whole, it's the, I mean, I felt like the way Council Member Nelson was describing it is the exact opposite of it, which is that right now, and as Housing Justice Project has informed us many times, right now renters are using their J.P. contract, and this is like a secondary line of defense, what this bill constitutes, or the area that this bill is in. But in fact, that contract ends on, ends starting July 1st. So, starting July 1st, you know, in June.",housing
"But as far as why this bill removes any requirements for reporting from renters is because statistical evidence overwhelmingly from throughout the country, and in fact, internationally, shows that actually means testing not only hurts working people and the poorest and the lowest income people, also, it doesn't work. It never works in the way that it's supposedly intended, because it actually creates complications. And so, in the spirit of the position that my office has had all along, there's nothing inconsistent with what we've done.",housing
"We are advocating that we remove the means testing requirement entirely. And I can tell you, after having succeeded our office and the renters rights struggle in the last eight years, after having succeeded in winning bill after bill for renters rights, despite the opposition of many council members, we have, every time a bill has passed, we have heard from council members, oh, that will create legal risk, this will create legal risk, there's nothing that we have passed, that supposedly does not create legal risk. But the overwhelming majority of renters rights stance, the $15 minimum wage stance, everything was, you know, we basically the sky was going to fall down if you pass anything progressive.",housing
"And I just wanted to say I will be supporting this bill with or without the amendment because preventing any confusion about renters having access to this defense against eviction is the priority. However, all means testing in my view is just based on statistical evidence is deeply invasive and humiliating. So I will be voting no on the amendment.",housing
"What this amendment would do it strikes two of the recitals here that are specific to the way that council members on spill is crafted. And what it does is restore much of the text as you'll see in the dashed underline in red that was struck in council members on spill. It restores that text and adds the requirement here that the sorry, not the requirement, excuse me, the presumption the tenants about a tenant submission of a declaration or self certification of financial hardship, and explicitly states that the landlord may read a presumption and it does so both for 090 and for section 22 205 100.",housing
"So based on the vote, there's a recommendation from the committee to pass the bill as amended. So the bill as amended in simple terms simply adds that landlords can rebut the assertion, the assertion from renters of financial hardship. So as of now, what the bill does is simply add that opportunity for landlords to rebut.",housing
"There is one item on tomorrow's City Council agenda from the Sustainability and Renters' Rights Committee. This is a bill from my office in response to a Court of Appeals decision that objected to one small part of Seattle's six-month eviction defense. That ordinance requires renters to attest that they have suffered financial hardship in order to be eligible to use that defense against eviction, and the Court of Appeals objected to the mechanics of that attestation, specifically that there isn't language giving landlords the ability to rebut the claim that the tenants are facing financial hardship.",housing
"I want to be clear, as I've been throughout and also at the committee on Friday, that the six-month eviction defense is still in effect because the City has appealed the Court of Appeals decision. However, out of an abundance of caution and particularly to avoid confusion, my office sponsored this bill to respond to the Court of Appeals concerns. The initial version of the bill drafted by my office addressed the Court of Appeals concern by simply removing the requirement for financial hardship.",housing
"Therefore, there would be no claim to rebut. As I've argued in the past, it should be a given that if a renter is in eviction court, it's because they have suffered financial hardship. There's no other reason they would be there.",housing
"It's not like it's something anybody would desire to have on their rental record. Requiring people to declare financial hardship, particularly if they're landlords, start challenging those claims drags the renters through a humiliating process that in reality has a chilling effect, preventing the very people this eviction defense was intended to help from using it. The bill was discussed in the Sustainability and Renters' Rights Committee last Friday, and it was amended to address the Court of Appeals concern in an entirely different way than what I just stated.",housing
"Instead of removing the requirement for financial hardship, in other words, instead of removing all the elements of means testing, the bill now keeps that requirement and adds language explaining how a landlord can rebut those claims of financial hardship. I did not support that amendment for the reasons I just explained. However, as I said in committee, I still support the legislation because it will allow the eviction defense attorneys from the Housing Justice Project to use this eviction defense without fear of confusion.",housing
"I recently reached out to the Northwest Housing Justice Project about getting out of my lease and getting my money back because of unsafe, unhealthy, oppressive living conditions that are denying the pursuits of happiness, destroying mental health, and endangering physical well-being. The lawyer informs me there's no codified law to protect renters from abusive, intimidating threats by landlords about eviction for complaining about horrible living conditions, financial decisions, refusing to hire qualified security, and stopping the criminals conducting war on the property, refusing to trespass or call the cops while they sit inside their office, and no protections from flawed obsolete designs that ruin eye sight and walls that shake like a bomb went off, and heating units that are forced into the hallway like the owner creates a wind tunnel draining our heat so he can heat his building, save the money. Now, separately, and a different concern, council looks like they're setting aside 35 million dollars in finance committee to give raises to government union employees except for the cops while same council refused money to restaff cops and voted to defund 50% while continuing to run interference for evil crack meth and heroin pushers and customs violating illegal aliens.",housing
"Good afternoon. My name is Tram Larson and I'm the community engagement manager at the Housing Justice Project. We provide free eviction defense for low-income renters in King County, and on behalf of SJP, we support council members to launch proposed ordinance that amends the language in the COVID-related defense to eviction that addresses the issue that was raised by the court of appeals.",housing
"As this council recognizes May as Mental Health Awareness Month, keeping someone housed is critical to their mental well-being. If we acknowledge that the past two plus years is still impacting us, we cannot exclude tenants that are still struggling to pay from this narrative. It is disingenuous of landlords, both big and small, to claim that they have been left out of the conversations around renter protection, when in fact they have been prioritized and brought to the table.",housing
"Mayor Harrell hosted a roundtable with various stakeholders before deciding to end the moratorium. This bill speaks directly to the concerns for landlords, so I urge this council to pass the ordinance to match their support for their constituents' mental health. Thank you.",housing
Report of the sustainability and renters rights committee agenda item 14 council bill 120330 an ordinance relating to just cause eviction changing the terms of certain eviction defenses and amending sections 22.205.090 and 22.205.100 of the Seattle municipal code. The committee recommends the bill pass as amended. Thank you.,housing
Council Member Swant? Thank you President Juarez. This is a bill from my office in response to a court of appeals decision that objected to one small part of Seattle's six-month eviction defense.,housing
That original ordinance requires renters to attest that they have suffered financial hardship in order to be eligible to use that defense against eviction. The court of appeals objected to the mechanics of that attestation specifically that there is not language giving landlords the ability to rebut the claim that renters face financial hardship. I wanted to be clear that the six-month eviction defense is still in effect as I mentioned in the council briefing yesterday as well because the city has requested reconsideration of the court of appeals decision.,housing
However out of an abundance of caution and to and particularly to avoid confusion my office has sponsored this bill to respond to the court of appeals concerns. The initial version of the bill introduced by my office addressed the court of appeals concern by simply removing the requirement of financial hardship therefore there would be no claim to rebut. As I have argued in the past it should be a given that if a renter is in eviction court it's because they have suffered financial hardship because why else would they be in eviction court.,housing
Requiring people to declare financial hardship particularly if their landlord starts challenging those claims is likely to drag renters through a humiliating process. We see that happening all the time and this in fact has a chilling effect preventing the very people the low-income and marginalized communities that this eviction defense was intended to help from using it. The bill that was the bill was discussed in the sustainability and renters rights committee last Friday and was amended to address the court of appeals concern in an entirely different way instead of removing the requirement for financial hardship the bill now keeps that requirement and adds language explaining how a landlord can rebut those claims of financial hardship.,housing
I did not support that amendment for the reasons I just explained however as I said in committee and yesterday I still support the legislation because it will allow the eviction defense attorneys from the housing justice project to use this eviction defense without fear of confusion. While the six month eviction defense is technically still in effect there is a danger that eviction court judges will choose to evict renters who attempt to use the defense and because of that confusion. If that happens renters will be out on the street without the opportunity to appeal with all the human suffering that that entails.,housing
So I urge council members to vote yes on this legal fix to the Seattle six month eviction defense in accordance with the committee's recommendation. Thank you. Thank you council member Sawant.,housing
"The countless tenants that we worked with were also afraid that the six months would not be enough time for them to catch up, avoid eviction. Our eviction defense tied to the civil emergency was pursued because we knew that tenants needed another layer of defense. As recently as this morning I heard the need from a tenant attorney for this defense will be necessary when rent relief runs out later this spring.",housing

"Every six months is a tremendous burden for a small landlord like me, which means that I have to complete a report frequently and come up with all kinds of different bits of information about the property. And what this does is it drives small landlords like me out. The city of Seattle is losing thousands of rental units as a result.",housing

"We need much stronger rental protections in this town. It's heartbreaking to talk to someone who's lived in their unit for, you know, five, ten, fifteen years, and they can't afford a rent increase, and they end up on the street. These are very common sense, small steps.",housing
"I think we should take them. The people complaining, saying they're small landlords, I have to cry tears. They can afford to give me some data.",housing
"The level of transparency that this ordinance would create is a small step towards leveling the playing field and preventing displacement.

"Sometimes small landlords are the worst. They think they're entitled to pad the cost of their home, forcing renters to welfare subsidize their mortgage and lifestyle while never being professional. One of my girlfriends was forced to carry buckets of water from the kitchen sink to the bathtub after working a full day for Kroger because the shower and bath pipes were filled with black and brown sludge.",housing
"Yet the landlord acts like a lazy person talking about he will get around to it when he gets around to it like an abusive husband and like he has more important things to do than taking care of real problems for renters he's ripping off. Being abusive, unprofessional while she's forced to be friendly because she lives in a different part of the house. Yet the renter's rights committee doesn't protect renters from abusive landlords that overcharge for run down rentals.",housing
Only thing council is attempting is to make it seem small-time landlords are a benefit to community that quite frankly we could do without. We simply need better choices in homes and no shady small-time landlords can pay their own mortgage instead of ripping off renters being totally unprofessional and not being held honest with renter protections. This is more big bank democrat punch pulling.,housing
"So Madam Clerk, can you please read that item into the record? Report of the Sustainability and Renters' Rights Committee Agenda Number One, Council Bill 120325 Relating to Housing and Displacement Mitigation, Expanding the Information Required for Submission under the Rental Registration Inspection Ordinance for Rental Housing Units, Requiring Submission of Rental Housing-Related Information, and Amending Chapter 22.214 of the Seattle Municipal Code. The Committee recommends that the bill pass with a divided vote with Council Member Sawant, Lewis, and Morales in favor and Council Members Nelson and Juarez opposed.",housing
"Colleagues, Council Bill 120325 will efficiently fill a longstanding gap in data collection and analysis for Seattle's rental housing inventory, which will generate several benefits, including key data needed to measure and prevent economic displacement of existing residents from our dynamic and growing city. Seattle's Rental Housing Registration and Inspection Ordinance, RRIO, adopted several years ago, already requires landlords to submit a list of their rental units. And this bill would simply have property owners include that list along with rental rates, occupancy status, and square footage of each unit to a research university to compile and analyze this important data.",housing
"No personal information of the tenants would be provided. For the past several years, our city government has lacked the level of detail needed to understand many details about Seattle's housing inventory, including the extent of affordable housing that's not subsidized, but still has below market rents, usually because that housing stock is older, what some refer to as naturally occurring affordable housing. This legislation also follows through on our Statement of Legislative Intent, OPCD-004A-001 that Council adopted in November 2020.",housing
"Also, we've seen the budgets of OPCD and STCI increase substantially from 2021 to 2022. As part of the new bill that was introduced a few weeks ago, we did insert a sunset clause. So for landlords concerned about the ongoing burden of providing a list of information that they would normally have for their own record keeping and tracking of rental revenues, this bill contains a sunset clause to end this process by December 2025.",housing
"It will be good to have more data about the rent landlords charge. This bill simply requires landlords to disclose the rent that they charge so that policymakers can have accurate objective data. So it is pretty ironic that in public comment landlords have simultaneously claimed, both today and at the committee, they simultaneously claimed that they charge low rent and also objected to actually disclosing the rent they charge.",housing
"I definitely support refining it so that the sunset clause is clearly in all the sections. I'm not, you know, it will definitely make for a cleaner bill. I am concerned a little bit with giving the department all that time because the first date when the rental information is due is in October and we really want to get the information as soon as possible for the comprehensive plan.",housing
"But there is a question of how many months that contract will be if we get that contract, and of course it's hard to, unless we have a city-owned piece of property or county-owned piece of property, it's hard to go rent a place like a private RV and not have to like, you know, rent it for a year or multi-year or something like that. But if the council or the executive have ideas for publicly-owned property, that would be ideal. Otherwise, we will have to just hunt around with private owners.",housing
"Sorry. Is this a model that's used in other cities? It's very similar to the way an appeals court might work, I'm told by my attorney friends.",housing
"No, this is normal. This happens all the time. And this just meets City of Seattle Municipal Code requirements for accepting property rights.",housing
"And you have a civil rights office that I could say this unconstitutional also, because this is the 21st century. We shouldn't be having any problems with how to get a home, how to get a loan, how to get a job or anything like that. And that Jim Crow sign down there, Black Lives Matter, or downstairs, and over there at Seattle Municipal Tower,",housing
They're violating the old salvaged refused to enforce American with Disability Act and the Fair Housing Act of 1958 though. The menu 1988?  3000 why.,housing
"But also wanted to take a minute to thank the teamsters. My understanding is as of yesterday, they have begun to do some work, even though they are definitely still on strike. And I can only imagine that's a really tough thing to do because sometimes the strike is your last leveraging opportunity, but since these companies are peers, they're just going to pass the costs on to all of us.",labor
I'm also from Rainier Court. I actually was in a wheelchair. I was in a wheelchair for five years.,labor
So we are still working with the union on a four 10 schedule. Just working out some of the details. One of the concerns in just general is just the staffing level.,labor
So what changed under Ordinance 126293? The number of employees was modified. It could be an unnominated number of employees working in a home occupation.,labor
"This table was a side-by-side comparison of what is being proposed in the legislation before you and SDOT's existing registry system. Since we talked about this at length last month, I will just kind of remind you of the key differences. Here we have the commercial liability insurance coverage is required, but SDCI has discretion to determine what is the appropriate amount.",labor
"Amendment four, that would create business days. Then the substitute would also bring the penalty structure into alignment with SDOT's. Very helpful.",labor
"Finally, as Councilmember Herbold indicated, I will be joining Councilmember Herbold and Work in Washington on Thursday for a press conference to announce some initial legislation regarding work and labor standards for workers typically known as gig economy workers, and look forward to making some statements with Councilmember Herbold at that time and kick off that big body of legislation that has been a lot of work and a long time coming. So looking forward to taking that to the next level and looking forward to committee this coming Wednesday, so I'll see everybody there, if not sooner. So in keeping with the thread here, I'm going to ask if there's any comments on my presentation.",labor
"She will begin her duties when she returns later this summer. Lastly, I want to congratulate the Amazon workers. If you haven't already seen the incredible news that came from New York over the weekend, a huge note of congratulations to the Amazon workers from Staten Island for their recent unionization vote.",labor
"This is the first vote and the inaugural convening, I guess, of the Amazon Labor Union, marking the first time U.S. workers have formed a union within Amazon. They received praise and congratulations from folks in Bassemere and across the country who are looking at similar unionizing efforts within Amazon. And with the rise of unionization in places that we don't expect to normally see unions lately, notably within Starbucks and Amazon, I think that folks are really celebrating, and rightly so, and I think that there's a lot of opining happening as well among labor analysts who are looking at this as really a historic indication of the next iterations of union organizing in this country.",labor
"This union was formed by Christian Smalls, a former and fired Amazon employee who was fired after walking out for protesting pandemic conditions at the warehouse two years ago. An Amazon executive tried to tap down his participation by using incredibly demeaning language that I'm not going to repeat, but this is a really great show of strength and solidarity that two years later, Christian Smalls is now the president of the Amazon Labor Union. He and his coworkers have formed the first Amazon union in the country and have really been an incredible voice to stand up, not just for the health and safety of workers in that location, but across the country.",labor
And I'm an organizer with working Washington on the pay up campaign. I'm here in support of the payoff ordinance on the introduction calendar today. The payoff campaign was created from the necessity of what gig workers want and need.,labor
"A good pay, flexible work schedule, the ability to work without harassment. Workers found this type of work to be enjoyable, satisfying and suited their needs. Workers that had taken pride in their work.",labor
"I know personally because I'm a former Instacart shopper. I personally witnessed and felt the effects of the companies changing their contracts over and over again, lowering the pay and making the job worse time and time again, putting us all in a financial tailspin. Today over 40,000 workers in our city are, are only offered sub minimum wage excluded from basic worker protections.",labor
"Responsible for all ever expanding expenses. And on a downward spiral to be the next poverty level, the working hand to mouth. We gig workers have been working on creating standards and laws for ourselves for a long time now.",labor
"And after years of organizing a year of stakeholder meetings and policy development, it's time for city out. Seattle city leaders to deliver for gig workers by dancing our policies to raise pay, protect a promise, a promise, flexible schedule and provide meaningful transparency to those that are working in the gig industry. The gig economy has grown by leaps and bounds.",labor
"And even though they haven't had the same look as other service jobs do, we can see the far reaching effects that gig work has had on jobs that may traditionally been a part of a company that now can be outsourced to the smartphone or computer. We must take action now so that the standards are in place to protect workers and not demolish hard fought labor protection. This is a common sense policy that ensures workers are paid at least a minimum wage after expenses with the flexibility and transparency we need.",labor
"I'm a gig worker on Grubhub and I'm here to support the payout policy. Drivers are paid on average $3 to $5 per order. If I break every traffic law and get super creative with parking, an easy order might take me 15 minutes.",labor
"Doing simple math, that's $20 an hour on the high end. From that $20, I need to subtract my expenses, taxes, gas, car insurance, and constant maintenance and repairs, like the cost of flat tires or a new battery. That $20 per hour quickly falls below minimum wage after driver's expenses are calculated.",labor
"Apps promise flexibility and being your own boss, but in reality, they are the boss, controlling us with penalty and threats of deactivation. Flexibility is not simply, I have some free time, let me log on and earn a little pocket cash. For me and thousands of gig workers like me with hidden disabilities, flexibility means the ability to work at the pace and intensity that I need on a schedule that I can manage.",labor
"Gig work is my only source of income and the only industry that allows me the flexibility that I need. However, the promise of flexibility is being eroded as apps ramp up controls to maximize their own profits. The payout policy would protect the flexibility I need while guaranteeing I'm also paid fairly for my labor.",labor
"Hi, I'm Terri Herstad, and I am here asking for support for the payout campaign. I've been working with the gig economy since 2019 with the Handy app directly. And in the past three years, I have seen and experienced with Handy alone a false promise of flexibility.",labor
"I've also seen a false promise of scheduling control. I have seen blatant denial of responsibility by the Handy app in terms of customer service, both towards contracting professionals and the client. And Handy continues to this day to behave as a cleaning agency that hires employees rather than the technology company that they are actually billing themselves as.",labor
And we know that the app contractor relationship has been broken for years. And we know that there's been no demonstrated stewardship by app companies to fix this. We need changes made to the contract.,labor
And we know that contract changes have always been made by the app. We know that these changes have always favored the app. And we know that these contract changes have never favored contractors.,labor
"Regardless of the app, none of these contract changes have ever favored contractors. They've always favored the app. And this is why today I'm saying blatantly with blatant logic, we need your support of Seattle City Council in passing the pay-up policy.",labor
"We need you to set the example of local legislation that develops and strengthens stewardship and partnership between contractors and the app companies themselves. Because without quality partnership, we will never become a better economy. Thank you.",labor
My name is John W. I've been a gig worker on Rover for two and a half years. I'm here to talk about why gig workers need the pay-up policy.,labor
"As a Rover worker, I'm grateful for the level of control I have over my own schedule, but I think that it could be better. Rover presents itself as just being a marketplace like Craigslist where customers can find walkers and sitters, and there is some truth to that. But the reality is that Rover exercises too much power over its workers to simply be considered a marketplace.",labor
"Rover still tries to control my schedule by lowering my search rating when I don't accept jobs that are within my preferences, meaning I won't be shown to potential clients as often, which hurts my business. But the preferences that the app allows me to set are very primitive. I believe that updating the app to allow for more customization would fix some of these issues, but ultimately it will never be capable of factoring in all the nuances of whether a job is worth it to me.",labor
"So I believe the search rating system needs to be replaced with an unbiased system. The system could show sitters to clients randomly and allow the client to filter based on preferences that are important to them, like proximity, price, average rating, etc. Being selective about which jobs I take allows me to make a decent amount of money per hour while still keeping things relatively affordable for the customer.",labor
"This directly impacts the amount of work I'm able to squeeze in a given time period and the time I have outside of work to relax, spend time with my family, take classes, etc. Also, in regards to pay, I believe that a pay floor consistent with minimum wage needs to be established for Rover and other gig working apps to avoid pay being driven down over time. This needs to factor in the extra time and cost associated with being a contractor on each app.",labor
"It's important that workers are not only able to survive, but also take steps to improve their standard of living over time. Thank you for supporting gig workers. Next speaker is Shelby Hampson.",labor
"Hi, can you hear me? Yes. I'm Shelby, and I'm a gig worker on Rover, and I'm a member of the Pay Up campaign.",labor
"I work for the Rover app, which is a pet-sitting and a dog-walking service. I thought it would be fun to work with pets, and while I was pet-sitting, I had some owners who were not honest with me, and that left me with medical bills for being hurt by a dog. The reason why I work for Rover is for the flexible schedule.",labor
"I have medical appointments that help me manage my disabilities, and these take precedence over a regular 9-to-5 work schedule. Without this type of flexibility, I honestly couldn't work. So with the pay and without the health coverage, it's just not worth the dangers.",labor
"Rover would also encourage gig workers to always maintain a low pay threshold in order to undercut other Rover workers. This base pay is not enough to sustain a livable wage. When you have to choose between food to stay alive, or transportation, or even rent, this is no way to live.",labor
Changing your price point to something lower only hurts us. It hurts all of us in the long run. We need the Seattle City Council to pass the Pay Up policy for gig workers and set the pay standards for gig workers in 2022 because I need to be able to pay my bills and for basic survival.,labor
"We started in 2015. And I am here to just speak on behalf of our over 2,000 members, gig workers and various app-based platforms that we are collectively excited about having been part of the stakeholder meetings with council member Herbold for the delivery pay standard. I would like to voice our greatest concern about this proposed bill is what we are calling a one-size-fits-all, that the delivery community is urging for change and upgrade, especially in light of what upgrades that have happened to the TNC statewide regulation and what's to come from that.",labor
"But we would like this bill to be focused on delivery gig work as it is a unique sector of gig work and as we have heard in the stakeholder meetings for the better part of this last 12 months, that it has unique factors that affect, you know, like the cost. And creating a standard is, of course, novel for the entire industry. And as we're hearing from the gig workers that are a part of those stakeholder meetings, that it is a very challenging feat for companies and for the gig workers to manage standards.",labor
So we do ask that the delivery standards be focused on delivery. Thank you so much for your time. I'm here for your comments and we'll be sending in additional comments.,labor
"No, we have a collection of classes. That particular class is, Is between 20 and $25 per credit hour. So it's $399.",labor
"We offer a discount for, you know, when, when people enroll a whole staff or a number of people, but our, our costs for delivery, we've intentionally kept low. So all of our courses between 20 to $25 per credit hour. Additionally, it's, it's all online.",labor
"For. For producer processor retailer. That you can buy a business, but you can't currently apply for business.",labor
"And as you all probably know, we have nine unions here that, uh, that are in our operation. Uh, she would be a, uh, our board labor representative, which is one of our positions, uh, to help the board and the staff in this area, as well as her experience with workforce development council. So we're excited about that.",labor
"To me, that's supporting our immigrant and refugee rideshare drivers who've been reaching out to me in this new role. And that means working in partnership again with the Office of Economic Development, the Office of Labor Standards to advance the priorities of immigrants and refugees. We know that wage theft among immigrants and refugee workers is widespread and largely unreported.",labor
"The controls and incentives agreement has a very detailed list of items that can be reviewed by the staff through that application process. There's also a detailed list of things that are accepted from review so that they don't need any review other than for the owner or the management to say, we're doing this, and I say, oh, that's consistent with the agreement. In-kind",labor
"That bill establishes a statewide regulatory framework for TNCs. It includes statewide worker classification for TNC drivers, minimum compensation, paid sick leave, and workers' compensation. It does, unfortunately, preempt the city with regards to labor standards.",labor
"While we will be seeing a statewide system set up, we will no longer be able to do the enforcement that was housed in OLS. We did secure some delays to the 15-cent reduction in local fees that will be transferred to L&I to fund the statewide driver's resource center. Rather than taking effect immediately, those will not take effect until 2023, nor will the preemption of our local authority.",labor
"I think the only thing I would probably do a follow-up, but just do it with you guys offline, is the TNC that passed, you know, and how that preempts what the city has done. You know, sometimes when Seattle passes laws and then it goes statewide, it's a good thing. I think a good example is $15 minimum wage and what that did.",labor
Maybe help to avoid confusion. I want to send my congratulations to all of the workers at the Staten Island Amazon warehouse and the Amazon labor union. Who successfully organized a union. In an absolutely historic victory against this behemoth of a corporation.,labor
"This is the first successful unionization drive at an Amazon warehouse nationwide. The union ALU Amazon labor union spent $120,000 overall race through go fund me. The Amazon executives on the other hand, spent more than $4.3 million just on anti-union consultants nationwide last year.",labor
"The union's bylaws state that no union leader, no executive board member of the union will be paid more than the workers they represent. This is. Really.",labor
"This is incredible. This is a very important step. I don't know of very many unions who have the, such a constitutional requirements in their union.",labor
"And it is extremely important as part of an accountability structure. The organizing drive also has done an excellent job highlighting that the corporation's executives. Are not only not on the side of the workers, but that they are vehemently opposed to the union.",labor
"And that they will. Employ every tactic on the books to, in order to undermine the union drive. In fact, Amazon has filed charges against the union that are based on.",labor
"Complete falsehoods. But importantly, the organizing drive also highlighted. Concrete demands that the workers need to fight around.",labor
"These are demands that will make if they, if the workers win, we'll make a real difference in their lives. Of course, now the challenge is for. The union to win.",labor
"To unionize more workplaces and coming up next is the union election at LBJ five, which is, you know, literally across the street from JFK eight, which has unionized. So also on a sort of Amazon sorting house. On.",labor
"So, you know, the union election has been a struggle for a long time. It's been a struggle for a long time. And it's been a warehouse after warehouse, certainly the more difficult task of winning the first contract.",labor
"And my office and my organization, socialist alternative, send all our solidarity in that ongoing struggle. This past weekend, my office and I personally joined Starbucks workers at Mary's bill in Washington. At their picket line.",labor
"And they have just joined Starbucks workers at a marketplace, and I'm now filed for their union election. And they have also highlighted many concrete demands, including a living wage. With adjustments for inflation.",labor
"And they join many other, you know, hundreds of stores nationwide Starbucks stores that are filed for union election. Okay. So that is my report.",labor
"Lastly, we'll be hearing a presentation from Seattle Central staff on the bill, Council Bill 120294. This is the first bill in the pay-up policy package, which addresses minimum payment transparency and flexibility for gig workers or contract workers who are not protected by our other labor laws. I want to note that Councilmember Lewis has joined the meeting.",labor
"Thank you. Good morning. I'm the Executive Director of Working Washington, here to express our strong support for the payout policy, which will raise pay, protect flexibility, and provide transparency to gig workers currently excluded from our city's labor standards.",labor
"Our city has taken great strides in recent years to advance equity and to center the voices of historically excluded workers. Ending the exclusion of gig workers from labor standards will make work better for people of color, immigrants, workers with disabilities, LGBTQ workers, and single parents. No one should be working for less than minimum wage in Seattle in 2022.",labor
"Passing this policy is a racial justice issue, which is why organizations like One America and Somali Community Services have endorsed it. Partners including the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance and Seattle Restaurants United support it because they agree that providing basic protections to gig workers is critical to ensuring an equitable recovery. This is a well-crafted labor standards policy, which has been developed through an extensive year-long stakeholder process.",labor
"The work has been done, and it's time for action. Let's make gig worker exclusions a thing of the past. Thank you.",labor
"Hello, this is Talisha Herald. Thank you for hearing me. I started doing gig work in 2014 because my work as a sales rep shut down due to the pandemic.",labor
"At first, gig work was my full-time employment, but as I started seeing how easily shoppers were deactivated without inadequate, without adequate review and appeal process, and unfair pay, inconsistent pay, untransparent pay, I decided to start my own shopping business. I still do sometimes shop for Instacart in my open windows, but it really shouldn't, not every gig worker should have to start their own business so that they can ensure that they're going to be treated fairly by opportunity, pay, and transparency. Thank you.",labor
"For the record, my name is Molly Jones, and I'm the vice president of public policy at WTIA, a nonprofit dedicated to fostering an equity-centered tech sector that empowers thriving communities. App-based companies enable essential economic functions from food and grocery delivery that have provided a lifeline to restaurants and residents during the pandemic to childcare at a time when our city is strained to provide resources that enable women to get back to work. Worker earnings in this sector are highly complex, and if regulated poorly, can adversely impact a broad ecosystem of merchants, customers, and workers.",labor
"We are concerned that this ordinance fails to incorporate sufficient stakeholder consultations, data, and learnings from industry partners who are at the forefront of the policy. For example, WTIA and our members recently partnered with state legislators, labor unions, and others to negotiate the first in the country statewide regulation of app-based ride-sharing companies. This cooperation is not only possible in Seattle, it is necessary for such a complex topic.",labor
My name is Magnolia. I'm a gig worker on TaskRabbit in Seattle. I'm here because I support the pay-up policy and I want to see action on it now.,labor
"I started doing gig work in 2020 after feeling unsafe in my job and after-school program, so I began cleaning homes on TaskRabbit. I now have my own business and clients, but I use TaskRabbit to fill the gap, and I rely on this app for steady work, not to mention before I set up a business, this was my only source of work. I want City Council to know that this isn't a side gig.",labor
"I'm not doing this to pay for vacation or to buy a PS5. I'm doing this to pay rent, buy food, buy medicine, survive. What I'm making doesn't give me the budget for much else, especially not enough to build up savings.",labor
"TaskRabbit controls the market rates by suggesting what you should charge for your work and warning if your rate is too high. New taskers are strongly encouraged to charge $18 per hour for skilled work. This is far below minimum wage, and even before expenses, this is far below a living wage.",labor
"I'm calling to speak on item number four. The businesses that make up the sharing economy operate in differing ways, ways that fit the individual needs of our unique customers, as well as for the workers who choose to seek out earning opportunities. The ordinance before you offers up a one-size-fits-all approach that does not account for these differing business models, creating the potential for additional barriers to entry for workers that ultimately drive down the flexible earning opportunities available to them.",labor
"This legislation talks about flexibility, something we care deeply about at Ships. It's worth noting that 75 percent of our shoppers choose to work less than 10 hours a week for Ships, and nationally, the 1 percent of Ships shoppers who choose to work more than 40 hours a week on average earn more than $67,000 a year. We provide shoppers with the info they need to make decisions on which offers are best for them, including the location, the estimated time it takes to complete an offer, and a pay estimate outlining the minimum they'll make on that job.",labor
"Hi, my name is Brian Rodriguez, and I am a Dasher based in Seattle. I am working to save enough to go back to school without having to depend on my parents and family. All of us are going through a hard time right now, especially with the pandemic, rising gas prices, and inflation, but Dashing has made it possible to remain financially free, all while making it to class on time.",labor
"Not having to choose between my education and making money has made me in certain times easier, and I wanted to say that way. I stand before you today because I worry that the current pay proposal is problematic. If we're trying to pass a proposal to help Dashers, I want to know that our legislators have done everything necessary to make it sure it actually does end up helping us, not hurting us.",labor
I ask the City Council to take more time to study pay ups so that you may better understand the consequences of this proposal before passing it. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you.,labor
"Hello, good morning. Thank you for listening to us. My name is Maria Hernandez, and I work for DoorDash.",labor
"We need a pay up policy so we can live with more dignity. I started doing good work in 2019 because I need flexibility to take care of my children, and because I started attending college. I get very low pay for the time invested, low tips and expenses on my own vehicle.",labor
"Not even mentioning the high prices of gas. I am living in poverty every day with no hope inside. I turn to friends and family for money to cover bills, and I still cannot pay enough on time.",labor
"Good morning. My name is Allison Ford, and I am the public policy manager for Uber in Seattle. I am providing public comment today with deep concern for the pay up legislation as it is currently drafted.",labor
"Uber is supportive of a driver earning standard policy. However, this earning standard formula is so complex and costly that it will lead to a significantly more expensive service. It has been drafted with no independent research to identify the cost to restaurants and consumers or what impact it will have on driver earning opportunities.",labor
"Our modeling estimates that this standard would result in the loss of thousands of Uber Eats orders a week, which ultimately hurts small businesses, reduces work opportunities for platform drivers, and limits access to delivery services for communities that rely on them. We request the council reconsider this important legislation by taking the time to fully understand the many potential unintended consequences. Thank you so much.",labor
"I started doing gig work in 2020 because I was suffering with an autoimmune condition that made it hard to commit to a 40-plus hour work week. Like many others, I depend on gig work to make a living. I'm speaking today because gig workers like me are tired of being taken advantage of by multi-billion dollar companies.",labor
"Tens of thousands of gig workers are still getting paid sub-minimum wages and are subjected to unfair and dishonest business practices. For me, low pay in the gig economy means any emergency that may arise can be devastating. A flat tire or health issue can mean possible homelessness.",labor
"I have faced many issues in the two years I've done gig work, including car accidents due to bad weather, injuries from carrying extremely heavy groceries, and over 60 denials of my sick pay claim because no one at Instacart even knew what the Seattle safe and sick time ordinance was for two years into it. We need the pay up policy now because gig workers deserve protection. These companies make billions and they benefit greatly from vulnerable gig workers not having a voice.",labor
My name is James Thomas. I'm a gig worker and I'm here because we need the pay up policy now. I received a small business pandemic loan that is coming through soon.,labor
"I borrowed the money based on being paid at $0.94 a mile by Postmates the day that I signed the loan agreement. Now the pay on Postmates has been reduced by over $0.22 per mile. Unlike restaurant and tap house owners, I don't have the ability to raise the prices on my menu, so I have no choice but to pay the loan back over a longer time to struggle to fit it in my budget.",labor
"As defined by the city of Seattle, gig workers are small business owners too. Council Member Nelson, as a small business owner, you should understand the need to charge enough for what you sell to make a profit. Right now, gig pay is so low that after our expenses, we earn next to nothing.",labor
"Large corporations are making money hand over fist. As you heard, they don't own the cars or pay any of the expenses to make the business go. Thank you so much.",labor
"My name is Mackenzie Chase, and I am the Policy Director at the Seattle Metro Chamber of Commerce. I'm here to speak about CB120294 relating to app-based workers. The Seattle Metro Chamber supports legislation to ensure that app-based workers make a competitive wage as well as new innovative ways to allow app-based workers to access benefits like the state legislation, HB2076, which allows TNC drivers to access benefits.",labor
"The chamber strongly urges you to take the necessary time to craft balanced and thoughtful legislation to achieve these goals. As currently drafted, this legislation could apply to diverse business models from pet care to food delivery. These businesses include apps in which workers set their own rates and access schedule services and blocks as opposed to individual deliveries and jobs.",labor
Okay. My name is Kedane Dayane. I'm a member of the pay app campaign.,labor
"So we are strongly asking the Council members to put into consideration the unseen or the hidden consequences, which is putting too much pressure on the livelihood of the people who are working with the gig workers. So the gig companies, they just make all the money, but the gig workers, they don't make that much. So now, as we see, the living standard between the rich and the poor is getting wider and wider.",labor
"I am here respectfully testifying in opposition to the pay-up policy proposal. TechNet recognizes the importance of ensuring access to flexible, independent work. This type of work allows families in need of supplemental income, including periods of unemployment or underemployment, to gain access to work on demand.",labor
"However, this proposal has been drafted without a single piece of the proposal. The proposal is designed to address a single piece of research to support it, so it is unclear what the impacts might be on businesses, gig workers, or the community. We are concerned that it could have negative consequences, like higher prices for consumers and reduced availability of delivery opportunities for Seattle drivers.",labor
We respectfully ask that the Council pause to take the time to fully study the impacts of the pay-up proposal before moving forward. Thank you for your time. Thank you.,labor
"I am testifying today in support of CD 120294, the pay-up legislation, and for me and many other caregivers, the pay-up legislation hits very close to home. Many gig workers covered by this legislation were historically excluded from minimum wage laws and labor standards. We received minimum pay with no benefits and no protections, like workers' comp or unemployment, and no protection from anti-discrimination laws.",labor
"It should come as no surprise that gig workers, like caregivers, are disproportionately excluded from minimum wage laws. Over the last two decades, caregivers came together and fought back, winning the right to protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act. I am proud that my union endorses the pay-up legislation.",labor
We are opposed to the current version of the payoff policy proposal. Members of this committee should be aware that the unintended consequences of this bill will likely result in decreased demand for the delivery services offered on delivery network companies' platforms. It'll increase costs for consumers and will ultimately jeopardize earning opportunities for workers.,labor
"According to Instacart's calculations, the formula outlined in the ordinance would put the minimum pay rate at approximately 170 percent of Seattle's minimum wage, already the highest minimum wage in the country. The premium pay on food delivery networks companies is still in effect, which raises the minimum standard even higher, yet there's been no effort to assess the potential impact of this proposal on consumer demand, and by extension, earnings opportunities for Seattle workers. We have sincerely appreciated the ability to take part in stakeholder negotiations, and we'll be submitting a counterproposal that we hope will be considered in future drafts of this ordinance.",labor
"This policy would create a minimum pay to start for those who aren't able to set pay rates, but I'm able to. Even with setting down a pay rate after the expenses is over set, I can use a minimum of $12 to $15 an hour, which is still not minimum wage. If you passed the emergency ordinance in 2020, I was a good worker.",labor
"I was eligible for it because it's happened to those who are delivering food and supplies. We need to make sure that this TANF policy benefits all of us that work on acts such as rovers, cats, rabbits, and mice. While I'm not sure that any workers are able to supply in this job, be thoughtful.",labor
"My name is Mary. I work for a pay-up competitive. I worked for Instacart for a few years, actually a few years ago, a few hours a week only, between $35 to $40 a week.",labor
"The charge of transportation weekly was a lot, and it took a lot for my pay. It was sneaky from the company. They did not pay enough income for the expenses.",labor
"They would increase the pay, and they would take more, while we as workers would shop and deliver, and making it much more harder for us. On many of the shoppers. It was not enough to be able to pay for living expenses.",labor
"I'm Michelle Balzer. I am a shopper for Instacart, and I am actually, you know, obviously in favor of this, and the biggest reason in the last few months, I've seen a big drop off in customer orders, and my fear is that with this mass hiring that Instacart does, and a lot of the gigs do, service has kind of gone down, and therefore customers are not real, have a lot of faith in their orders and what they're going to get and that they're correct, and I think part of this payout policy and the pay flow will ensure that quality increases, because they're going to be paying for the good shoppers. They want people who are shopping fast and shopping accurate, and so this really would benefit the companies, the customer, and the shoppers.",labor
"We'd be ensured that the good people who actually want to be doing this job and care about the customers would be out there shopping, and we wouldn't see the decrease. We'd see an increase, if not stabilization of the customers, and I think Instacart would see the increase. Thank you so much.",labor
"While I was pet sitting, owners were not honest with me about the aggressiveness of their dogs. I was hurt with less than medical bills, and I was not able to work with dogs because I had such a fear for them. Rover would always encourage their workers to always maintain a low pay threshold in order to undercut other Rover workers.",labor
"This base pay isn't enough to sustain a livable wage, let alone to deal with medical bills. Rover takes 20 percent of each and every job I do. When you have to choose between food to stay alive, or transportation, or even rent, this is no way to live.",labor
"Thank you, Council Member. My name is Erin Paso, and I'm representing the Washington Coalition for Independent Work. Members of our coalition have long advocated for minimum earning standards for their industry.",labor
"They advocated for the recently adopted earning standard in California and currently support a ballot measure in Massachusetts that would provide the same benefits for workers. Unfortunately, the proposed pay-up legislation, while well-intentioned, is poorly drafted. This Seattle City Council proposal increases costs without regard for consumers.",labor
"Pay-up Would broadly mandate that drivers be paid more than double on a per-trip basis without regard for the impacts on small businesses, consumers, and ultimately, drivers themselves. If costs for delivery services are arbitrarily driven out of reach for consumers through mandatory regulation, then everyone will be hurt, including the drivers who will lose work as consumers choose other options or simply forego certain services.",labor
This Seattle City Council proposal is far too broad. Pay-up Would go far beyond delivery services in our coalition and would impact sites like Angie's List and Care.com.,labor
"Before I hand it over to Amy Gore on central staff to go over her presentation, I do want to address a couple things I've heard in committee. I've heard some folks suggest this is a one-size-fits-all approach to the different gig economies, and that is not the case. This proposal recognizes that there is a difference between what we call on-demand delivery companies and marketplace network companies with different approaches to each, and we'll learn more about that in a moment.",labor
"And then there's some reference to a belief that the city should commission a study to inform the policy from folks who are skeptical that gig workers are making under minimum wage. And I just want to remind everybody that when the city considered and passed similar legislation to protect transportation network companies, there was a study commissioned by the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of Berkeley, and they confirmed that workers were making significantly under minimum wage. And then after expenses, those workers were only making $9.73 an hour.",labor
"Today, I have a presentation on Council Bill 120294, which would establish a minimum pay standard and related regulations for app-based workers. In this presentation, I will give an overview of the legislation as well as outline some policy considerations for the committee. The committee has had three briefings on this legislation as it was developed, so most of the basics of the legislation will be familiar to you.",labor
"Given the time, I'm going to try to go through this quickly while pointing out changes from the last committee discussion, but I also want to hit the main points for folks who may be just starting to track this legislation now that it has been introduced, so I really appreciate your patience. Network companies rely on a business model that treat app-based workers as independent contractors. That means that they are not covered by employment standards established by federal and state – federal, state, and local laws.",labor
"This legislation is one of a suite of policies that the committee has been discussing under the umbrella term pay-up proposal, which are intended to establish labor standards for these app-based worker – workers. The suite of proposals include those listed on the slide, which, again, I won't go through because we have talked about them quite a lot. This bill, Council Bill 120294, would address the first three of these policy goals.",labor
"It would establish the minimum pay standard, set transparency requirements governing information that is shared with workers, customers, and the city, and it would establish flexibility standards that give workers more control over their work availability. In addition, it would require a notice of rights for workers, establish recordkeeping requirements for network companies, prohibit retaliation, and authorize the city's Office of Labor Standards, or OLS, to administer and enforce the requirements. The legislation and the package of policy proposals, as the chair mentioned, has been the subject of community engagement since June of 2021 and has been discussed in the committee three times prior to today.",labor
"First, covered workers would include workers accepting offers to perform services for pay via a network company's worker platform. The legislation would not cover workers offering the sale or rental of goods or real estate. It does not include licensed professional services, including creative work and digital services.",labor
"It does not include workers providing transportation services through taxis or TNCs, and it does not cover workers who meet the definition of employees of the network company or the customer. For companies, a covered company is any company that has 250 or more app-based workers worldwide and that use online-enabled applications or platforms to connect customers with workers or present offers to workers and or facilitate the provision of services by workers. What is not covered is any company offering services that simply enable individuals to schedule appointments or process payments when the company does not engage in any additional intermediation of the relationship between the customers and the workers, and does not provide oversight of the services that are provided.",labor
"It also does not cover any companies operating digital advertising and messaging platforms when there is not intermediation of the relationship or oversight of the services provided. And similar to workers, it does not cover taxis or transportation network companies, either as defined by the city or as defined by the state. In addition to the definitions for covered companies, as Councilmember Herbold mentioned, there are two types of network companies which are defined separately in the legislation and would have different regulatory requirements.",labor
First is on-demand network companies. These are network companies that primarily facilitate or present on-demand offers. An on-demand offer is one that must be initiated within two hours of acceptance.,labor
"On-demand companies can include those that facilitate delivery from eating and drinking establishments or grocery stores, but are not necessarily limited in that way. Second, we have marketplace network companies. These are network companies that operate differently than other network companies.",labor
"They facilitate pre-scheduled offers where the company or customer and the worker exchange information on the scope or the details of the service and then agree to a price for those services. The company does not monitor the app-based worker's location, mileage, or time. And just to be clear, a company that does not fit the definition of a marketplace network company or an on-demand company can still be considered a network company and covered by the legislation.",labor
They are not intended to be mutually exclusive. The primary impact of the legislation would be the establishment of a minimum payment for app-based workers. The goal of the minimum payment is to require that a network company either provide or ensure that the customer provide both the payment of a minimum wage in addition to expenses that the app-based worker is covering themselves.,labor
"The minimum payment is calculated using two primary inputs, engaged time and engaged miles. Engaged time is the time that a worker performs services for an offer. For marketplace network companies, because time is not monitored by the company, the engaged time is based on an estimate agreed upon before the offer is accepted.",labor
"And that is agreed upon by the customer and the worker. Engaged miles are those miles that are traveled by a worker during engaged time. And again, because marketplace network companies do not track miles traveled, engaged miles would not include any miles that are traveled when performing services facilitated by a marketplace network company.",labor
"So to go into a little bit more detail about engaged time, for on-demand network companies or when an offer must be performed within two hours, engaged time would begin when the offer is accepted and engaged time would end when the offer is completed or the offer is canceled by the company, the customer or the worker cancels the offer with cause. And we will get into the conditions under which an offer can be terminated with cause shortly. As I mentioned previously, engaged time is the time it will take to perform the offer.",labor
"But for marketplace network companies, it would be estimated by the customer and worker prior to the offer acceptance. For marketplace network companies, engaged time can be both flexible, for example, one hour of work in an eight-hour period, or it can be non-concurrent. For all other offers, engaged time would start when the app-based worker begins performance of the offer or reports to the assigned location.",labor
"And then engaged time ends when the performance is complete, when the offer is canceled by the company, or when the worker cancels with cause. This slide just summarizes the calculation of the minimum payment, which is the per minute amount multiplied by engaged minutes plus the per mile amount multiplied by engaged miles. In the next slides, I'm going to go into a little bit more detail about the per minute amount and the per mile amount.",labor
"For the per minute amount, it includes a minimum wage equivalent, which in 2022 is 28.8 cents, as well as an associated cost factor of 1.13 to cover non-mileage expenses that are necessary to conduct app-based work and associated, and sorry, an associated time factor to cover the time that app-based workers spend working or engaged to wait for work without compensation. Therefore, the total per minute amount is 39 cents. The per mile amount includes the standard mileage rate set by the Internal Revenue Service, 58.5 cents per mile, as well as an associated mileage factor to cover miles traveled without compensation.",labor
"In the legislation, the per mile amount is initially set at 1.25, and this results in a total per mile amount of 73 cents. As discussed, the minimum wage equivalent for app-based workers is based on our city's minimum wage for Schedule 1 employers, and that is defined in SMC Chapter 14.19. In 2022, it's 17.27 per hour, which works out to about 28.8 cents per minute.",labor
"This slide itemizes some of the types of costs to be covered by the associated cost factor, such as payroll tax, state paid medical leave, and unemployment. As noted before, the legislation would set the associated cost factor at 1.13 initially, and it would be adjustable by the OLS Director, excuse me, the Office of Labor Standards Director, after three years, though the director could not reduce it below 1.13. This slide, slide 18, itemizes some of the costs to be covered by the associated time factor, such as rest breaks and time reviewing offers.",labor
"It includes time to become available for tasks and for administrative tasks related to their app-based work. The legislation would allow the director of the Office of Labor Standards to review and change the associated time factor, but could not reduce it below 1.21. This slide itemizes the cost to be covered by the associated mileage factor, such as the expense of miles driven while a worker is not engaged on a specific offer.",labor
So the legislation would establish a minimum payment per offer of at least $5. That would be adjusted annually at the time at the rate of inflation. The legislation would also allow the director to exclude certain offers from the minimum per offer amount.,labor
"So that might include establishing a grace period during which a customer can cancel an offer without the minimum payment. The legislation now specifies that the grace period set by the director could not be more than five minutes after acceptance, and that is something that is new that was not included in the legislation that was discussed previously by the committee. The legislation would impose transparency requirements intended to provide workers with information to help them choose which offers to accept and to verify compliance with the minimum payment standard.",labor
"It also provides customers with information on the charges of the offer, and it provides the Office of Labor Standards with regular and routine access to company records that are needed to ensure compliance with the minimum payment standard. The information required as part of an offer has remained mostly unchanged from prior committee discussions. However, I wanted to highlight that since the last committee discussion, a definition of unsealed has been added to the legislation, and these requirements have been changed to only include unsealed order contents to be disclosed to the worker.",labor
"As discussed previously, the legislation would require electronic receipts to both workers and customers within 24 hours of completion, in addition to a weekly statement to the worker, as well as a 14-day notice before changes to the way that payment is calculated. And sorry, that is a notice to the worker, I should clarify. And I also just want to note that this slide says significant changes.",labor
"However, the legislation currently specifies that this requirement applies to material changes. That was something that was agreed to by the stakeholders. So I just want to highlight that that has been changed in the legislation.",labor
"The final component of the legislation is flexibility requirements. The legislation would require that app-based workers be allowed to be logged into the platform when they choose, without limitation, except for health and safety restrictions, as well as giving workers the right to decide work availability and the right to accept or reject any offer. And that would include any type of offers or any number or proportion of offers from the network company.",labor
"Let's see. In addition, the legislation would allow the app-based workers to cancel offers with cause under the circumstances listed. And that would include that the offer information is inaccurate.",labor
"The offer cannot be completed due to the customer actions. And that would be, for example, if the customer is not there unless it is a contactless delivery. And also that the timely completion of the offer is unsafe or impracticable, or if there is a good faith complaint about sexual harassment or discrimination on the behalf of the worker.",labor
"Finally, this is the last slide about the actual legislation overview. So, the effective date of the legislation would be 30 days after signing. However, the provisions of the new chapter would not go into effect until 12 months after the legislation's effective date.",labor
"This is to give the Office of Labor Standards more time for outreach, engagement, and rulemaking. Before I move on to policy considerations, I wanted to stop and see if there are any questions from the council members about the overview of the legislation. Okay.",labor
"Seeing none, I will go ahead and move on to some policy considerations that the committee may want to think about during deliberation and the amendment process for Council Bill 120294. First, I wanted to highlight potential impacts to workers, customers, and businesses. As has been discussed in the committee previously, this legislation is intended to address pay for app-based workers.",labor
"But like most labor standards and business regulations, it will likely have other impacts, particularly on businesses that use network companies for deliveries and for customers who utilize these services. For example, the pay standard would likely increase the cost of operations for network companies, and those companies could pass that increase on to customers or partner businesses. If these increases are unsustainable, companies could choose not to do business in Seattle, which would obviously have detrimental impacts on businesses and on the workers.",labor
"However, it's very hard to predict or quantify what these impacts may be. I did a search for any studies detailing impacts for similar regulations, but as you know, this type of regulation is very new, and therefore there's not significant data or analysis on pay standards specifically for app-based companies. I also looked for analyses of the impacts from pay standards and regulations for transportation network companies, which has some similarities to this bill, obviously.",labor
"In Seattle, the fair share legislation established minimum payment standards for TNC drivers that went into effect on January 1 of last year. There were reports like middle of last year from TNC companies that the regulations resulted in a 50% increase in cost per ride. However, I haven't seen that data independently verified.",labor
"In addition, the TNC companies report that demand for rides is recovering more slowly in Seattle than in other markets, which they attribute to the higher cost of rides. Because of this, the committee may want to consider enacting the legislation as proposed and funding a study to monitor the impacts of the regulations with the intention of modifying the regulations based on the study findings. The committee could also delay enacting legislation in order to fund a study to examine and model the potential impacts to businesses and workers and customers to inform development of the policy.",labor
The next thing that I wanted to highlight is the legislation's coverage of businesses and workers. The legislation currently includes broad definitions for company and worker coverage to be clarified and detailed during rulemaking. The benefit of this is that it provides more time to get into the detail of different operational models and develop rules which reflect the nuances of various companies and how they operate.,labor
"In addition, this is a rapidly evolving industry, and creating this detail in rulemaking rather than the legislation can create more flexibility to make revisions moving forward. However, some stakeholders have communicated to Council that they would prefer that additional details about coverage be determined by Council and codified in the legislation. So the committee may want to consider providing additional clarity and specifics related to coverage.",labor
"For example, that offers performed by workers covered by an employee relationship while they are performing the offer are excluded. The committee could consider amending the legislation to change the definition of covered network companies to provide more detail on concepts like facilitate or present or intermediation, which are all terms that are used in the definition of covered companies. The committee may want to amend the legislation to provide other clarifying language related to coverage, or they could amend the legislation to require additional clarification through rulemaking.",labor
"The next issue I wanted to bring to the committee's attention is about marketplace network companies. As we discussed, these companies use a model which does not track time, mileage, or geography of work. This makes applying the payment standards very difficult.",labor
"The legislation establishes different regulations for marketplace companies, for example, that engage time is based on estimates prior to acceptance of the offer, and that miles driven during an offer are not considered when calculating the minimum payment. This may result in less effective worker protections, but also may not fully reflect the operational model of all marketplace network companies. The committee may want to consider amending the legislation to add regulations for marketplace network companies to strengthen and clarify the requirements.",labor
"The committee may consider amending the legislation to require additional clarification through rulemaking, or the committee may want to consider amending the legislation to exempt all or some marketplace companies or offers from the minimum network payment. I do think I just want to highlight that there are some really important protections related to flexibility and transparency, such as the ability to cancel with cause, that if marketplace companies are excluded completely, because it's hard to do the payment calculations, that would exclude them from those other protections as well. So we might want to talk about the pros and cons of the level of exemption of those companies if that is something that the committee wants to pursue.",labor
"Fourth, I wanted to talk a little bit about the adjustments to associated factors. As discussed previously, the associated cost factor, the associated time factor, and associated mileage factor are all intended to reflect the expenses incurred when a worker is performing app-based work. The legislation states that the associated cost factor and associated time factors may be adjusted by the OLS director, but that they may never go below the initial rate set in this legislation.",labor
"It is possible that the covered cost could change significantly. For example, if the state takes action to include app-based workers in the state unemployment insurance or paid family medical leave programs, the cost of covering those expenses the cost of covering those expenses could be decreased significantly for workers. So the council may want to consider amending the legislation to allow associated factors to be decreased by the OLS director if the needed components change significantly or change or decrease significantly.",labor
"In addition, the legislation does not explicitly authorize the OLS director to adjust the associated mileage factor, and the committee may want to amend the legislation to provide that authorization as well as guidance for any adjustment that the director might choose to implement. So the next to last issue is that the legislation would authorize the Office of Labor Standards director to issue, revise, or rescind rules to administer and enforce the minimum payment standards. In some cases, rulemaking is required, and in some cases, rulemaking is discretionary.",labor
"And if you're interested in the specifics of these, we can either discuss them later. They are also included in more detail in the memo. Similar to company and worker coverage discussed previously, using rulemaking can provide flexibility.",labor
"However, some stakeholders have requested that the legislation go into more detail on policies rather than rely on rulemaking. And so the committee may want to consider amending the legislation to include specific policies rather than delegating to rulemaking. They might consider amending the legislation to include more specific guidelines for policies delegated to rulemaking, or finally, they could consider amending the legislation to change whether specific rulemaking is required or discretionary.",labor
"I believe this is the last slide related to policy considerations. So OLS has provided the council with an estimate of the cost to implement, administer, and enforce the minimum payment standards that would be established by this council bill. They estimate that the cost would be $1.2 million in 2023, including $670,000 for staffing costs and $567,000 for non-staffing costs.",labor
"Thank you very much, Madam Chair. So we heard public comment, and I don't think anybody was, let me just start again. I absolutely support delivery drivers making a living wage and all of our public comment people, companies, I'm referring to the companies, the network companies here did say that they also support minimum wage standards.",labor
"My problem has always been the inevitable unintended consequences on the drivers, the small businesses that are supported by these apps and the customers when you impose a single regulatory framework on such a wide diversity of business models. So we got some letters this past week, and you flagged the notion of having a study. I will say that I do support having a study to look at these, to consider these particular impacts, and I can go into what that study would include, but I am not the only one saying this because, let's see, the Seattle Metropolitan Latino Chamber says, we're deeply concerned about the unintended consequences that Seattle payout may have on our community, specifically because there's been no third party or independent research or studies about this regulation yet.",labor
"And Bishop Gary Tyson of the General Baptist Convention of the Pacific Northwest says, he makes the note that his community benefits from app-based work and says, we believe this legislation must be set aside to do the work to better understand its impacts on the communities that we work to connect and empower. And you noted a study that had been done, but these comments do call for an independent research. And there was, so it all comes down to, well, which consultant are you going to use?",labor
"Well, the advocates of the proposal have been running the stakeholder outreach and meetings. And so there is a bit of a conflict of interest there, but just in the past two weeks, a whole new category of company has been invented, marketplace companies. And that's because some very nuanced concerns from service providers, app-based service providers, the companies that don't just deliver things that provide services to people in need, their concerns were finally being heard.",labor
"And so, and regulations were refined to address those concerns and a whole new set of rules and regulations apply to those people. So my point is that that's basically whack-a-mole, because as soon as you solve for one problem, then other problems pop up. And some of these companies like Angie and care.com just found out about this legislation by accident.",labor
"So one option that was not presented in policy considerations is to, well, I'll say my preferred one, which is to eliminate market-based companies altogether from this legislation, because it was clearly designed to raise the wages out by delivery, not necessarily income of delivery drivers. But another suggestion I would have is to pass the legislation, but delay its implementation until OLS can complete its rulemaking process. And that rulemaking and those rules would be approved by council.",labor
"Council Member Nelson, you referred to it as a single regulatory framework. It is not a single regulatory framework, as mentioned earlier. There is a different definition for marketplace apps and a different regulatory standard that they have to meet that is significantly different than for the on-demand apps.",labor
"Just stepping back about what the goal of this effort is, it is about making sure that people are getting at least the minimum wage for their work in this city. I would be interested to learning about the impacts of that very, very basic standard and seeing if there are things to do to mitigate those impacts, but not as a prerequisite to the legislation. Again, this is a minimum work standard that we are looking to extend to these workers.",labor
"A local study at the University of Washington showed that the increase of, for instance, our $15 minimum wage did not lead to higher products or costs for products for consumers. The decision of whether or not to increase prices on products and services is wholly within the company's jurisdiction. We know there are many inputs and outputs of these financial decisions, and one is the profit.",labor
"You don't have to increase prices. I would argue that if you want to make sure that people are still buying your product, it is not really the best business practice to increase your prices if it is going to impact the interest of people buying your product. There are other ways to look at addressing the cost for, again, this very basic minimum standard to protect workers.",labor
"I really appreciate that you are digging into the difference between the marketplace and the on-demand apps, and I look forward to having more conversations. Our thinking on including the marketplace apps in this legislation is really in recognition that this particular sector of our workforce has evolved exponentially, almost in an inverse relationship to the increase in worker protections. As we have passed more laws to protect workers, the number of people who work who don't get those rights has increased.",labor
"We don't want to create the same sort of dynamic with this legislation that by not regulating the marketplace apps, we create a big loophole that the employment model shifts to take advantage of that loophole. We want to make sure that everybody is paid fairly for an hour's work, including covering the cost associated with doing that work. Councilmember Lewis?",labor
"As you state, this draft includes a fairly detailed start in talking about these marketplace apps versus delivery apps, for example. That is a direct result of engagement with the marketplace apps talking about how their model is distinct and what the different issues and the kind of activity they engage in are. I will own up that I still have ongoing questions and concerns about the extent to which this legislation interfaces with the marketplace apps, but that is all part of our legislative discussion and legislative process.",labor
"Councilmember Nelson. To answer your question, I am not saying that a minimum pay standard is the wrong way to go. The unintended consequence, which has been documented, is a drop in demand.",labor
What happens to the income of drivers when demand drops? Now we are talking about behavior. That is what I was talking about when I said unintended consequence.,labor
"We also have to think about the end customer because there is a convenience factor here. We cannot predict the continued, as you said, evolution of these kinds of companies, but it is being driven by demand for access and convenience. Nowhere in this legislation is it contemplated that what is happening is that consumers want a flat fee for services.",labor
"The calculation that is on the books right now, I did the math, and it is about $34.35 for three 20-minute, five-mile drives. Again, caution, because these are very complex. If we are concerned about the delivery drivers, why not just take that body of work and proceed?",labor
"As I said, the marketplace company definition was just included in the past two weeks. There is clearly a lot of work that has to be done before we get to perhaps more issue identification at the next meeting when we will have other important things on the agenda. Thank you so much.",labor
We can work from home. We can pursue hobbies. We can host guests in our home.,labor
"And finally, FAS has the Consumer Protection Division that is continually tracking House Bill 2076. Governor Inslee did sign that bill into law with a small section veto related to exempting transportation network companies from the state's common carrier status. In doing so, the governor cited the lack of obligations for TNCs to protect consumers and hope the legislature would address this issue in the future.",labor
"Other items that have been already identified for issue ID include specific adjustments to the inputs to the minimum compensation, including the cost factor, the time factor, and the mileage factor. That's been highlighted as potential issue ID with some options. And then rulemaking, whether or not things that we are identifying in the legislation should be delegated to rulemaking or whether or not they should be answered in the legislation itself.",labor
But it's less than 2% as of February and has continued to close. The other thing we're seeing is that the dynamic of labor shortages has created some bargaining power for workers. And we're seeing increasing wages.,labor
"We know something about the overall. The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the tax is very specific in that it only applies to. Salaries paid.",labor
We're no longer charging credit card fees. Regardless of where you stand on the policy choices being made. They affect the revenue stream.,labor
"Colleagues, just a few updates, excuse me, just a few public service announcements. This Thursday is Workers Memorial Day. This is a day commemorating the lives lost on work sites throughout Washington State.",labor
"More than 50 years ago on April 28th in 1970, the Occupational Safety and Health Act went into effect, promising every worker the right to a safe job, which is a fundamental human right. The law was won because of the tireless efforts of the labor movement, which organized for safer working conditions and demanded action from governments, both local and national. Since then, unions and allies have fought to make that promise a reality.",labor
"And winning protections that have made jobs safer and saving lives is really important component, but that work is not done. Each year, thousands of workers are killed and millions more suffer injuries and illnesses because of dangerous working conditions that are preventable. According to The Stand, which is a publication, daily publication from the Washington State Labor Council, AFL-CIO, last year there were over 5,300 workers who were killed on the job.",labor
"And then another 9,500 died from occupational diseases. This means that on average, 275 workers in this country lose their life every day from hazardous working conditions. If you're interested in learning more about the Workers Memorial Day events on Thursday, you can join in on these with folks from the University of Washington Department of Educational, excuse me, Department of Environmental and Occupational Safety on Wednesday, the 27th at 11.30 a.m.",labor
"There's a Zoom that we will make sure to publish on our social media, as well as events throughout the day on Thursday. Look forward to not only honoring the lives lost, but continuing to call for safer working conditions for all workers. Keeping with the labor theme, congratulations to the Office of Labor Standards.",labor
"They had their seventh year anniversary this month and under the leadership of then Patricia Lee, then Karina Bull, Dylan Orr, Marty Garfinkel, Jene John, and now Steve Marchese. OLS has become a nationally recognized leader on labor standards, enforcing both labor standards and doing education and outreach to business and workers. This has been an important model across the country for looking at community and business strategies to make sure that we have safe working places and also that workers are getting access to the rights and responsibilities that are codified in statute.",labor
I'm seeing companies waving around concerns from some small businesses of color. We refuse to be pitted against them for the benefit of large corporations. Marginalized workers who depend on these apps shouldn't be excluded from basic protections and small businesses deserve to not be mistreated and people who depend on these apps deserve accessible resources.,labor
"This can only happen if PAYA is passed for people's dignity and these large corporations use their profits wisely, just like we are all required to do. And in case you're wondering, everyone deserves this basic right. We are against any amendment to exclude gig workers like dog walkers who have been advocating since the beginning.",labor
I urge you to move forward to eliminate subminimum wages for gig workers by passing PAYA. Thank you. Our next speaker is Howard Gale.,labor
"Carmen? Hello, I am Carmen Figueroa and I am with the Pay Up Campaign. Gig industry executives and shareholders have made millions of dollars in personal profit off of my labor and have no intention of investing in me or any of their workers.",labor
"Their lobbyists, some of which you will hear from during this forum, will make outlandish claims as to why gig workers should be paid sub-minimum wages. These lobbyists will attempt to steer the council into ridiculous superficial whataboutism debate and demands to delay equity with studies. They will also ask cleverly worded questions designed to pit minority small businesses against gig workers of color.",labor
"The apps have copious amounts of data that they continuously analyze. Rather than expand pay models, making social economic equality possible for gig workers, the apps use all their data to collapse pay models and transfer more profits to themselves. Thank you.",labor
"We feel strongly that the pay up legislation deserves more work and careful consideration to better understand its impact before it is passed. Despite a year of stakeholder meetings, there has been no attempt by the council to study the impacts of this legislation. DoorDash, however, estimates that we can expect costs to increase significantly for consumers, including those in low-income communities where 31% of our deliveries are made.",labor
"We would expect businesses to lose $74 million and dashers could actually lose $32 million in aggregate earnings next year because of the decrease in orders. DoorDash is not opposed to an earning standard and has, in fact, supported them in other parts of the country. However, this earning standard calculated at 200% of the Seattle minimum wage when using a typical DoorDash in Seattle is simply too high.",labor
I'm here to support moving forward on the pay up policy and passing it into law. I'm a member of the Labor Standards Advisory Commission and we have identified this as a top priority for advancing worker rights. We sent a memo this week to both the mayor and the council saying the same.,labor
"I wanna note we're an advisory commission representing both workers, businesses, and the community at large. But I'm here as a business owner today. I value fair treatment and living wages for my employees.",labor
Optimism has been tip-free since its founding because we believe that businesses should be responsible for workers' wages and not just the whim of our customers. Fair living wages are good for my business. It's good for the whole economy.,labor
"You've heard from many gig workers supporting this bill that they are not getting guaranteed living wages. And as a food business, we are expected to offer delivery to our customers, but I don't wanna do business with delivery services that don't pay minimum wage and don't provide basic rights to their workers. We don't have any insight into what these individuals are making and they are making their money off the back.",labor
"Okay, good morning. My name is Leif. I'm a former delivery driver for Uber Eats and I'm here in support of the payout policy.",labor
"While the scheduling freedom made the job strongly appealing for several years, I have decided that the drawbacks no longer make it worthwhile. The standard fare was already low when I began in 2017 and has been effectively cut with inflation. Granted, Uber has recently been providing us with an extra 35 cents per trip to compensate for inflating fuel prices, but this gesture is not enough.",labor
"We need our real mileage costs accounted for and the best way to do that is by basing mileage compensation on the IRS rate, not an arbitrary pay bump cited by Uber. Even with this bump, many jobs would leave me with only three or $4 after 30 to 45 minutes. Additionally, the exact tip amounts on Uber Eats are not visible until after the trip has completed, which means that I frequently have to guess if a trip is worthwhile.",labor
Requiring the tip to be visible on each trip would save drivers a lot of time with no negative consequences for Uber and creating a pay standard would mean we no longer have to guess if we'll make enough to make a job worth it. Thank you. Thank you.,labor
"Good morning. My name is Mackenzie Chase, and I work at the Seattle Metro Chamber of Commerce. I'm here to speak about CD120294 related to app-based workers.",labor
"The Seattle Metro Chamber supports legislation to ensure that app-based workers make a competitive wage. We also feel strongly that the legislation should be carefully drafted to address different industry realities. The issue is incredibly complex, and as currently drafted would apply to businesses involved in grocery delivery, childcare, and home repair.",labor
"We also urge city council to study and address unintended harmful consequences, especially for low-income residents. For example, someone with limited mobility who uses an app to get groceries. That's why we support amendments to study potential impacts on drivers, partner businesses, and customers.",labor

My earnings for the month of March was a little less than $1,230, and the cost of working was a total of $671. I brought home less than $600, which is a lot less than what the applications claim.",labor
"I brought home less than $600, which is a lot less of what the applications claim we earn. We need to be paid $0.73 per mile because the current cost is $0.58, and we handle additional miles between orders. It's urgent for us that we receive payment of $0.73 per mile because the actual mileage cost is of only $0.58, and we drive additional mileage between orders.",labor
"And the gas continues increasing its cost every single time that I go to fill up my tank. I am disappointed to see that the Seattle Latino Chamber of Commerce is against the payer policy. Thank you so much, Maria, and thank you as well to our interpreter for your services.",labor
"Good morning, council members. My name's Michael Wolfe. I'm the executive director of Drive Forward, and I want to start by saying immediately that Drive Forward does support the creation of a minimum earning standard for gig workers.",labor
"We've had discussions with you about our objections to some of the methods in which this bill enacts that standard. We would encourage continued dialogue around these issues, especially around the issue of setting the rate as a per-trip method, and that would, in our opinion, create an artificial cap at minimum wage and we believe gig workers should always have the opportunity to earn more than minimum wage. We also would like to see this bill split into two bills, one dealing with the marketplace companies and one dealing with the delivery companies.",labor
"Even our own research, a survey of delivery drivers last year showed that some drivers earned less than minimum wage, and this is why we support creating a minimum wage with these changes. Thank you. Thank you.",labor

"I'm a survivor of acute leukemia and the treatment that saved my life left me with chronic pain, fatigue, and lowered immunity. It's not safe for me to drive, and often I don't have energy to shop and cook my own food. Gig delivery is vital for me to get food and stay safe, and I see delivery workers as part of a helping profession.",labor
"Sometimes I feel guilty for relying on these apps, and I'm concerned about how companies treat delivery workers. I've heard lobbyists argue even today to counsel that raising pay for delivery workers could result in higher prices for people like me. I'm angry that they're using me to make an argument for their financial benefit.",labor
Gig workers deserve to get paid a living wage and be treated as valued partners. Thank you. Thank you.,labor
"Hi, my name is Alex. I'm calling in support of the payup legislation. I'm a PhD candidate and watch dogs in my home in District 3 part-time while I remotely work on my dissertation.",labor
"For over three years, I've used both the Rover and WAG apps that many pet parents and pet caretakers use to find each other. For many years, Rover has taken 20 or 25% of the price caretaker sets for a job, and WAG has taken 40%. Rover and WAG don't help with pet care after the initial introduction, and no, people quickly stop transacting through the apps.",labor
"So they take as much as they can, they think they can, get away with in the first booking, which can be hundreds of dollars for longer-term dog boarding stays. It may mean sub-minimum wages for on-demand dog walkers trying to support themselves from gig work. A large share of pet care work is now on these apps because of their convenience, which makes it hard for caretakers to get jobs elsewhere and avoid paying the high middleman fees.",labor
Marketplace gig apps that have dominant market positions because of these network effects need to be regulated and force them to have reasonable fees. Thank you. Thank you.,labor
"This flexibility is something our shopper community values. It's worth noting that 75% of our shoppers work less than 10 hours a week, and last year shoppers made, on average, between $25 and $35 per hour when factoring in offer pay, bonuses, and tips. Shopping",labor
And Delivery app-based work involves many nuanced and complicated factors in order to ensure the system works for both our customers and our shoppers. This potential law risks economic uncertainty and risks the flexible work opportunities that shoppers in Seattle value.,labor
"My name is Tiffany Alvendrez and I'm the Western Region Policy Manager for Instacart. Instacart is opposed to CB120294, the pay affordance in its current form. As we've previously stated, the proposal before you today is extremely problematic for customers, shoppers, and local retailers who use our platform.",labor
"And every member on this committee should be aware that it will lessen demand for the services offered on delivery network companies' platforms. It'll increase cost for consumers and jeopardize earning opportunities for workers. We ask council to consider the following amendments to the ordinance, a city-funded impact study similar to that performed for PNPs under their fair share legislation, removing the current per minute per mile formula and replacing it with a minimum earning standard of at least 120% of minimum wage, covering only independent contractors and not W2 employees who are already covered by city and state wage and hour laws.",labor
"Instacart appreciates the opportunity to take part in stakeholder meetings and will continue to work with city council members and other stakeholders as this moves forward. Thank you. Thank you, Tiffany.",labor
"Thank you. Good morning, council members. My name is Elena Perez with Puget Sound Stage here in support of the pay up policy.",labor
"We believe that all workers should have basic working standards and protection. That conviction by you and past city leadership and worker rights advocates has made Seattle a national leader in labor standards. But emerging app-based jobs have put that in jeopardy as gig workers on apps like DoorDash, Instacart and TaskRabbit are excluded from these standards and being left behind.",labor
"Multi-billion dollar gig companies get away with paying as little as $2 a job to the people who do the work. We have allowed these companies to pay a sub-minimum wage for workers who are disproportionately people of color, immigrants, workers with disabilities, LGBTQ folks and single parents. After a year long stakeholder process, it is well past time to close this loophole in our labor standards.",labor
"Raising pay and providing basic protections to our lowest paid workers is key to an equitable recovery alongside the PRO Act. Please vote to pay pass up, lift out, carve out. Thank you, Elena.",labor
We need to pay our pass and we need to pay out every job or shift that we do. Gopal's business can be different a lot based on the time of the day. We have to wait at a warehouse for orders and sometimes we only get one order in an hour.,labor
Each order only pay $4. Sometimes that didn't even cover our gas and mileage cost. Gopal used to be scheduled to block the guaranteed rate for every hour on the shift.,labor
"The rate was only $16.75 per hour. That's already below minimum wage, not even factoring our expense. Now Gopal has taken away the hourly late, we still have the clock in the warehouse and wait for all we earn is $4 per job.",labor
"If the pay then is meant to calculate per week, Gopal will keep paying only $4 per job. We won't get paid for all the time we work and we won't have the real transparency. Gig works need to know that every single job or shift will pay the least minimum wage, but spend the amount of cost for time we spend.",labor
"Eric. Good morning and thank you for the opportunity to let me speak with you guys today. I'm Eric, I've been a tasker with TaskRabbit in the Seattle area for a little over a year.",labor
"After many years working in the entertainment industry, I found myself in the position of needing quick but solid work opportunity. TaskRabbit really opened my eyes to the value of what I do. I never would have assumed that my services were worth what I've been found them to be.",labor
"And because I set my own hourly rate, I can be confident that I'm earning what I deserve. While I applaud the city council's efforts to make sure workers' rights are protected, I encourage the council to learn about the differences in companies that will be impacted in the process. I choose TaskRabbit because it's enabled me to work as an independent contractor.",labor
"And TaskRabbit has always respected my autonomy. I choose when I work, where I work, and my hourly rate. Anytime I take on a new booking, I communicate directly with clients without any interference from TaskRabbit.",labor
"As you work on this bill, please keep in mind that I really enjoy the hands-off approach that TaskRabbit uses and I don't want companies to have or use more oversight in order to follow new rules. Again, thank you for your time. Thank you.",labor
"I've worked across all the apps over the years and find that a division in any type of the marketplaces really would serve a dispurpose, several reasons. One, we wouldn't want people that have multiple skills or different passions, different abilities to be clamoring for one company and everybody at the same time. It would really kind of undermine service.",labor
"It leaves one service overly stocked and overly populated and another almost neglects it. But what's really my concern is that this bill, here we're talking about this in 2022, we're talking about equal pay. In 1963, there was a voting right established, laws established for the protection of our rights.",labor
"Good morning, council members. I'm Jamie Paschal, Director of Civic Innovation Policy for Chamber of Progress and Center Left Tech Industry Coalition Promoting Technology's Progressive Future. Our corporate partners include companies such as Grubhub, DoorDash, Instacart and Uber, but our partners do not have a vote or veto over our positions.",labor
"We urge the committee to oppose CB120294. This is a well-intentioned effort to help delivery drivers and service providers afford the rising cost of living in Seattle. But unfortunately, it will lead to a higher delivery and service costs, which in turn, higher costs for Seattle families and fewer orders for drivers and gig workers.",labor
"We all want to see livable wages for Seattleites, but because this proposal sets such a high hourly wage, services that help families like grocery delivery, meal delivery and dog walking will all see price increases in order to afford the increased weight. Not only will that drive up the cost for Seattle customers, but it will also increase demand for those services. This will have devastating consequences on our most vulnerable population.",labor
"It is my job to keep my ear in the ground and listen to the experiences of various gig workers. We have just about 2,600 members and several hundred that we have been in contact with, and they have been in contact with council members regarding the pay up legislation. We are supportive and very excited about moving forward with creating labor standards that make it a better experience out there on the road, of course, in finding a way to make a livable wage standard.",labor
"The biggest concern from the members is the confusion, the language. Some parts are ambiguous, and of course, it does include several different markets. The request is to narrow down the focus to delivery work and to bring the labor standards.",labor
"I'm here from SEIU6. We represent 10,000 workers in our community, including janitors, security officers, and airport workers. I'm here in support of the pay up policy to ensure gig workers in Seattle are paid at least a minimum wage after expenses with other basic protections.",labor
"Janitors and gig workers have a lot in common. Many of us are immigrants and people of color, and we're too often overlooked, disrespected, excluded, and treated as invisible. People working in the shadows to deliver food and do other gig work deserve to be paid at least minimum wage.",labor
"They deserve respect, and they deserve to have the city support to address the issues they face. Passing the pay up policy in Seattle will advance racial equity, put money into local restaurants and other community businesses, and give 40,000 plus gig workers the basic rights every worker needs. With a lot of hard work, SEIU6 has made being a janitor a good job.",labor
"We need to make gig work a good job, too. We urge you to support this policy. Thank you.",labor

"Why should a CEO, shareholder, or arrogant tech worker who thinks the world revolves around him, run away with my SSDI money? Meanwhile, nobody is properly paying the folks hustling hard to create all the value. I just went on a date with a chaplain who does gig work on the side to support his kiddo.",labor
"We bonded over the fact that he's on food stamps, just like me. Why is our government subsidizing filthy rich people to increase their profit instead? Thank you.",labor
"They like to claim that they're gonna have to raise pay instead of taking 400,000 or 400 million or whatever extra money they're giving to their CEOs and their managers. I tell you what, they don't really invest in anything in this town. I have an app.",labor
"They can't afford to raise, or they can't afford to raise prices because if they raise prices, then somebody's gonna come in and undercut them. They already charge restaurants. They already charge the customers.",labor
"They already make the workers pay for everything. They don't deserve to charge more money, and they know this for a fact. I'm a little tired of listening to companies come in here and tell us what their employees are making.",labor
"I make about $25 an hour because I have a system, and I live in downtown Seattle, and I work rushes. You cannot make more delivering than doing what I do. So I am just tired of hearing this company say about money when they lie, they misrepresent, and they don't deal with us honestly.",labor
"I am calling today regarding the pay-up policy with concern for the unintended consequences this bill could have if passed through in its current form. Uber continues to be supportive of a driver-earning standard policy. However, this bill will reduce access to work opportunities for platform drivers and adversely impact small businesses and increase prices on consumers.",labor
"We need to create accountability and justice for police as well as support system for community-based solutions in our beautiful city. We need to have salaries to be competitive across the board, which in return will set up small businesses and diverse residents for success. As far as gig workers in food industry, please come work for small businesses with fair wages and benefits.",labor
"As chair Herbold mentioned, today we will be presenting on agenda item five, which is council bill 120294. This bill would establish a minimum pay standard and related regulations for app-based workers. This is the second committee discussion on the topic since it was introduced.",labor
"So the first potential amendment for discussion is number one and it is found on page three of the memo. This amendment would change the definition for engaged time for on-demand companies and on-demand offers. As you recall, an on-demand offer is one that must be initiated within two hours of acceptance.",labor
"As drafted, engaged time for on-demand offers begins when the offer is accepted by the worker. It is intended to reflect that a worker may need to drive immediately to the destination or may be unable to accept other offers before initiating performance. So this could create a situation in which a worker is paid for time between acceptance and when they initiate performance of the offer.",labor
"However, we believe it's unlikely that there would be a two-hour gap very frequently between acceptance and initiation because companies will likely not present the offer until as close to initiation as possible and because workers are incentivized to initiate and complete offers as quickly as possible. But again, this requested amendment would change the definition of engaged time for on-demand companies and offers from when the offer is accepted to when the offer is initiated. This would likely reduce the amount of engaged time to some degree, but the impact will really be determined by the definition of initiate performance.",labor
"Currently, that term is not defined in the legislation. It was anticipated that it would be clarified by OLS through stakeholder engagement and rulemaking. Therefore, exactly how this amendment impact minimum pay would depend on that definition.",labor
"So as the council is considering the legislation, they might want to amend the legislation as described. It could provide additional clarity by defining what initiation of performance in the legislation means, or they could request or mandate that the Office of Labor Standards define initiation of performance through rulemaking, or they could make no change to the legislation at this point. Are there any questions about that one?",labor
"For this item, I did want to show you the table, which is on the screen now. As you recall, there are several inputs into the minimum payment calculation, and they are intended to ensure that the minimum payment covers expenses incurred by workers. They're not necessarily a one-for-one reimbursement of the expenses of each worker, but should generally ensure that the independent workers can afford similar benefits that workers classified as employees enjoy.",labor
"As noted in the memo, there has been interest in reducing the inputs to the minimum payment calculation. This includes reducing the associated cost factor from 1.13 to 1.1, reducing the associated time factor from 1.21 to 1.15, reducing the standard mileage rate from 0.585 to 0.3, and reducing the associated mileage factor from 1.25 to 1.05. On page eight of the memo is a table that shows the total impact on payment of these changes for several different types of offers.",labor
"As shown, these changes would reduce the minimum payment received by workers. I do wanna highlight that changing the standard mileage rate is somewhat different than the other changes that are requested. First, it would have the largest impact on the minimum payment.",labor
"In addition, the council bill, as proposed, would use the standard mileage rate that is set by the Internal Revenue Department, or Internal Revenue Service, annually. And so, therefore, the legislation does not contemplate any way to change the mileage rate. If the committee chooses to set a different mileage rate, they may want to change, want to consider how the rate should be adjusted in the future to reflect any changes in the expenses covered by the rate.",labor
"And also, they may wanna use a different term to avoid confusion with the sort of generally understood definition of standard mileage rate as being the one that is set by the IRS. So the options for the council to consider are to amend the legislation to reduce the standard mileage rate to 30 cents with no provision for adjustment or guidance on factors to consider for adjustments. They can amend legislation to reduce the standard mileage rate to 30 cents, but also add some sort of provision for discretionary adjustment by the OLS director with some guidance on factors to consider for adjustment.",labor
"The committee could consider amending the legislation to reduce the standard mileage rate to 30 cents with a periodic non-discretionary adjustment, for example, like based on inflation. The committee could also amend the legislation to reduce the associated cost factor, associated time factor, and associated mileage factor as requested. Or they could make no change to the legislation.",labor
The council bill as introduced would require that companies calculate the minimum payment for each completed offer. This requested change would allow companies to calculate the minimum payment per pay period. And there would be a maximum pay period of seven days.,labor
So basically a week. So the weekly pay standard is how pay is calculated in California. And therefore some network companies already calculate payments in this way.,labor
"And so if Seattle use this standard, it would not require any kind of technological or policy changes to meet the Seattle requirements. However, it could result in the minimum network payment acting as a pay maximum rather than a minimum. I think you heard some public comment about that this morning.",labor
"That is kind of what folks are seeing in California. In addition, app-based workers believe this change could reduce the opportunity to earn incentives, which are currently made primarily on a per offer basis. So the committee could consider amending the legislation as requested or no change to the legislation.",labor
"Thanks so much. So on amendment number 11 here, I was hearing some interest in making sure that there was weekly payouts, but now I'm understanding this to be more along the lines of averaging wages or compensation by an entire week versus the hours worked. Well, I understand that there's a reference to California.",labor
"There's no other worker pool that averages wages over an entire pay period. They're usually by the pay a lot, ideally by the hour, is that correct? Not aware of any other kind of app-based standard that is calculated on a weekly standard other than California, but I can look into that.",labor
"And you're right that I do think that there can be, when you talk about a weekly pay standard, there are sort of two ways of looking at it. One is how is it actually calculated? Is that by week or by offer?",labor
"And the request is, again, for the calculation to be by week. It's not just that they pay out weekly because the payout weekly could be based on, again, a calculation that is per offer. But yeah, I think just to clarify, this is about the calculation, not about just when it is paid out.",labor
"And I can look for some other examples of weekly payout standards for app-based workers, but I'm not aware of any offhand. Council Member Nelson. I think this amendment does get at one of my concerns that a potential reduction in demand for drives would impact overall income.",labor
And so I do think that this gets at looking at income based on previous weeks. And so this was put forward by Drive Forward and they've provided a pretty detailed rationale for this alternative way of figuring pay. It's very interesting.,labor
"Drive Forward and Working Washington are trying to address the exact same issue and want to solve for the same issue, but they have different ideas about how to do so. They are both concerned about creating a floor. Drive Forward is concerned that the daily standard will create a floor, and Working Washington is concerned that averaging over the course of the week will create a floor.",labor
"So the next item that I wanted to highlight is discussion number four, or for discussion is number 14, and it's found on page 11 of the memo. This amendment would remove the tip amount from the list of information that must be provided to a worker as part of the offer presentation. Just to clarify, it is only required if the company collects that information from the customer prior to the offer being presented to the worker.",labor
"This change is in response to a company's concern that providing tip information would enable some workers to only accept offers with the largest tips, which would make it more difficult for other workers to compete for the highest tip offers. However, given that tips can be a large portion of a worker's total compensation, knowing a tip amount prior to acceptance would give the worker more control over their pay and help them make more informed choices about what offers to accept. So the council members might want to consider amending the legislation as requested or making no change at this time.",labor
"Also, Amy, just a quick question. I don't believe New York City included this type of policy in their proposal, is that correct? New York City, I don't believe so.",labor
"And just to be clear, New York City hasn't yet implemented their changes. What they have done is requested that their version of OLS develop the policy. So it hasn't yet been passed.",labor
"Let's see, the fifth potential amendment I wanted to discuss was number 16, and it's found on page 12 of the memo. And the legislation as proposed would require that companies provide a written receipt to the worker within 24 hours. And it would itemize several things, including compensation, tip, engage time, and miles, and other information about the offer and how it led to the actual wage paid.",labor
"So what the requested change would give companies 48 hours to provide the receipt. So obviously that would help them just by giving them a little bit more time to develop that. However, on the other side or on the other hand, it might make it more difficult for workers to remember what happened two days before and to correct any receipts or pay that is incorrect.",labor
"And so in terms of options for this, we stated that the council members could consider amending the legislation as described or not change the legislation at this time. So the next two that I wanted to discuss are number 17, which is on page 12 of the memo and page 18, which is right after it. Both items 17 and 18 address marketplace network companies, but would be mutually exclusive as currently conceived.",labor
"As we've discussed previously in committee, marketplace network companies are somewhat different than other network companies. They usually do not intermediate the offer, but instead the customer and worker exchange information on the scope and details of any type of offer prior to the placement and acceptance of the offer. They also did not monitor offers by location or mileage or time.",labor
"And so in response, the legislation defines marketplace network companies and then has a different set of regulations for these companies, which we discussed in committee on April 12th. So there's interest in exempting marketplace network companies from the legislation. This exemption would mean that marketplace network companies would not have to make changes to their operations in order to comply with the legislation's requirement.",labor
"And I will note that both the companies and the workers are, they both would rather avoid creating more tracking of workers. And so that is a common goal, but it would mean that workers performing offers for marketplace network companies would not be covered by any of the legislation's protections, including the minimum payment standard, transparency requirements, like the information about the offer prior to acceptance, nor would they be protected by the flexibility standards, like the ability to cancel an offer with cause. So creating this, another thing I wanted to mention is that creating this exemption could incentivize network companies that currently don't meet this definition to change their operating models to avoid the regulations established by the council bill.",labor
"So the committee may want to consider excluding marketplace network companies from maybe like the minimum payment standard or other of the regulations that are most challenging, but maintain some of the transparency and flexibility requirements. So again, the options are to amend the legislation as requested, amend the legislation to exclude some of the regulations, but not all, or to make no change to the legislation. Are there any comments or questions about that?",labor
"Okay. So the seventh potential amendment for discussion is number 18, and it's found on page 13 of the memo. This is a second option for marketplace network companies, which would further revise the regulations of those types of companies.",labor
There are three specific changes that have been requested. The first change is to amend the marketplace network company definition to include companies that are primarily engaged in facilitating pre-scheduled offers rather than exclusively and that are primarily facilitating services without monitoring rather than exclusively. This change would expand the definition of marketplace network companies and may result in more companies meeting the definition.,labor
"It would also require more rulemaking by OLS to determine what primarily would mean in this instance. The second request is to change how engaged time is estimated for marketplace network companies. As you recall, for marketplace network companies that don't track the time a worker spends performing an offer, the engaged time can be based on an estimate that is agreed to by the customer and the worker prior, excuse me, to offer acceptance.",labor
"So therefore pay would be based on this estimate rather than the actual time spent working. This request to change would go a step further and state that the required reasonable estimate of engaged time could be met by listing the range of time and compensation equivalent to at least one hour of engaged time in a 24 hour period. This is intended to address situations like pet sitting, where there may be time spent either away from the task or when the worker is not completely relieved of duties.",labor
"However, it could further diminish the amount of engaged time for workers, making it less reflective of the actual time work and decrease the minimum pay for workers. The third request that I'm kind of putting under this bucket of marketplace revisions is to exclude marketplace network companies from the requirements to provide a weekly summary of offers, including like pay and other information for workers. As I mentioned previously, there is a requirement that there is a per offer receipt that is sent to the worker within 24 hours, as well as this weekly summary of those receipts.",labor
"And again, the request is that the marketplace network companies be excluded from that particular requirement. So the options related to this would be to amend the legislation with all or some of the amendments as described, or to not make any changes to the legislation, or as I mentioned before, to look at amendment number 17 to exclude them completely. So if there isn't any, are there any questions or comments about either 17 or 18?",labor
"It was basically council passes the legislation, OLS does its rulemaking, but the legislation cannot go into effect or be implemented until council then approves the rules that were developed by OLS. That might be a different way of going about rulemaking, but because so much detail is left to the rulemaking and a lot of companies out there who don't know yet that they will be covered because the rules have not been defined, we will have a chance to surface those concerns and perhaps make tweaks per their input. Thank you.",labor
"The next amendment is number 20 and it is on page 15 of the memo. And this amendment would appropriate funding for an independent study of potential impacts of the minimum payment regulations on drivers, network companies, partner businesses, and or customers. So the idea of funding a study, whether it would happen before or after legislation is not new in consideration of labor standards.",labor
It has happened in the past for paid sick and safe time when it was originally passed. There was an implementation study. This also happened before and after the minimum wage for employees before the minimum compensation standard for TNC drivers and before and after for the secure scheduling ordinance.,labor
"And then some labor standards are considered with studies done by advocates or policy organizations and businesses as well. So as far as considering items to inform a decision on whether or not to have a study, there is the timing aspect, which I just went over before, after, both passing legislation, the participation of stakeholders and whether the study would just be an academic study or whether the city would also engage the full range of stakeholders, of drivers and companies and workers and organizations, the administration of the study, what department would do it. In the past, it has been the office of the city auditor.",labor
"It was contemplated in the TNC minimum compensation ordinance that OLS might actually conduct a study. So that would need to be considered. And of course the cost, which varies on the breadth of the study itself for the TNC fair share legislation, the academic study was about $53,000 and additional money was spent on the outreach and engagement.",labor
"The secure scheduling study had a total cost of about $765,000 for a three-part study that included baseline and then two separate years of impacts after the legislation was passed. So options for considering this amendment would include postponing the vote on this bill to fund a study to examine and model the potential impacts to inform the regulations prior to voting. Another option would be not postponing the vote and funding a study to monitor the impacts of the legislation after.",labor
"Determine the funding needed for Office of Labor Standards to administer and enforce this bill. Currently, Office of Labor Standards is estimating that it would cost $1.2 million in the first year and ongoing to implement this bill. That would consist of about 566,000 for implementation costs which includes outreach, contracts with community organizations, translations, et cetera, and about 670,000 for staffing.",labor
"Are there any questions about that particular amendment? Okay, and then related to that is a potential amendment number 25, which would be identifying appropriate resources for Office of Labor Standards to administer this legislation. So currently, OLS reports that they do not have the resources to administer and enforce this legislation, hence their cost estimate of $1.2 million.",labor
"There are civil penalties already included in this legislation as with all labor standards legislation that could be used to support Office of Labor Standards. However, right now the practice of Office of Labor Standards is to prioritize directing civil penalties to the worker rather than to the office. And that is both to benefit the worker and also to avoid an appearance that the office is trying to collect penalties for their own benefit.",labor
"However, that could be changed so that Office of Labor Standards has mandatory penalties that could go to support their office or some jurisdictions have provisions that require the company to pay for the cost of the investigation. So that would be something that Office of Labor Standards could calculate. There are a variety of options for using penalties and fines to support implementation.",labor
Another option is the OLS sub fund. There is an existing law in SMC 3.15 that establishes a special sub fund to prioritize funding Office of Labor Standards from the city's business and occupation tax. The director every year sends council what is called a minimum annual contribution where the director says what is needed to support the office's enforcement and outreach.,labor
"The city does impose fees on businesses to fund regulatory or other administrative activities. The most relevant example would be the tax that TNCs pay per ride, and that covers estimated enforcement and cost of a TNC licensing, these vehicle endorsements and OLS enforcement of the TNC minimum compensation. So as far as options to consider, it could be expect OLS to voluntarily use some of their civil penalties to cover implementation costs, mandate that OLS use some portion of their civil penalties to cover implementation, use some of the business and occupation tax to fund the implementation cost or establish a fee or tax on network companies to cover these costs.",labor
"You're very welcome. And I'm not sure if I mentioned in my discussion of OLS's budget that there is, of course, the state bill 2076 that preempted Office of Labor Standards from continuing to enforce the TNC driver minimum compensation. So right now there are two positions that are funded and then there would need to be a decision on how to fund those in the future with revenues from that tax.",labor
"One area as well that we haven't talked about is our labor costs. And as you all well know, we have multiple labor contracts that are open this year for negotiation, and the outcome of those are uncertain. And so it's sort of a zero-sum game at the end of the day.",labor
"I wanted to speak on two potential amendments that we are against. The first is allowing companies to calculate minimum required payment on a pay period basis, rather than on a per offer basis. Companies are seeking this because it would result in a significant pay cut.",labor
"Not only would it lower workers pay and undermine transparency protections, but it also has no basis and how contractors are otherwise paid by offer. In addition, we believe this change would entirely undermine the intent of the policy. In fact, Seattle's fair share minimum payment calculation for TNC drivers is applied to each offer, as are the minimum payment agreed to by Uber and Lyft in Washington's House Bill 2076.",labor
"Every policy not run entirely by the companies calculates minimum pay on a per offer basis, because a weekly calculation is a pay cut in disguise. We reject exempting marketplace network companies. Removing coverage of network companies would entirely undermine the purpose of this ordinance, leaving thousands of workers without any protections.",labor
"The marketplace definition has not been crafted to identify a type of company where labor standards are not necessary, but rather to define a type of company that simply needs specific language to accommodate for how workers and customers interact. Using this definition as a basis to exclude workers could have disastrous impacts and incentivize bad actors to take advantage of what would become a loophole. Marketplace platforms like Rover and TaskRabbit have engaged robustly in a stakeholder process around the payout policy for almost a year.",labor
And stakeholders have worked together constructively to identify policy solutions which accommodate changing business models while also fulfilling the intention of providing basic labor standards protections to workers. The payout policy has been designed as a broad labor standard for gig workers who are currently exempt from such standards. We urge you to reject these amendments and pass the legislation as intended.,labor
"Hi, my name is Anna Powell and I'm the Manager of Government Relations in the Northwest for DoorDash. We are opposed to DoorDash, or to, we are opposed to payout as introduced and feel the Council should pause to study and fully understand its impact to the community before it is passed. As the City Council considers legislation that may cut over $32 million in aggregate earnings for dashers due to declines in order volume, it's important to separate myths from facts.",labor
"You may have heard the phrase sub-minimum wage. The fact is, dashers in Seattle earn, on average, $28 per hour while on delivery. The average dasher works less than 10 hours a week and does not rely on the platform as their only source of income, but instead to supplement full-time work or achieve financial goals.",labor
"In fact, we know that 36% of dashers in Washington have dashed to avoid needing to apply for government benefits and 68% of dashers have dashed to make up for lost income or reduced hours at work. Finally, and as you may even hear during today's public hearing, proponents will say payout was designed with industry input. The fact is, while we appreciate the ongoing conversations with stakeholders, we feel that our input has not properly been considered or included in this legislation, and we do not support the payout proposal.",labor
"I'm Shelby, a gig worker on Rover and a member of the Pay Up campaign. Rover has always encouraged their workers to always maintain a low pay threshold in order to undercut other Rover workers. Their safe pay isn't enough to sustain a livable wage, let alone to live without some sort of debt.",labor
"Rover takes 20% of each and every job I do. With a workforce of over 300,000, Rover makes over $1.5 million per singular job at any given time. When you have to choose between shelter, food, or transportation, this isn't a way to live.",labor
Forcing people to accept low wages is another way to disenfranchise people and force them into poverty. And poverty affects us all. Rover is in our own backyard.,labor
"And as a Seattle company, you would have thought they would have treated us better. We need the Seattle City Council to pass the Pay Up campaign now to help us. Thank you very much for listening to me speak.",labor
"Good afternoon, Chair Herbold and Council Members. My name is Toby Crittenden, and I'm here today on behalf of Seattle Restaurants United, or SRU, which represents over 240 small and independent restaurants here in Seattle. SRU is strongly in support of Pay Up, and we urge you to advance the legislation.",labor
"Our members are business owners who want to see our city and our economy reflect our values of community hospitality. We believe that when the most marginalized in our communities are truly cared for, it's good for our business, it's good for our customers, and really it's good for the city. Over the past few years, I think as everyone's aware, delivery apps have become an increasingly large part of the restaurant business.",labor
"More and more of our members make use of these apps and depend on delivery to keep business moving during tough times and to serve customers where they are. Now the apps present their own challenges to restaurants, charging large commissions and sometimes even listing restaurants without permission. The City Council moved to impose a commission cap that required apps to get permission before listing restaurants, and those are great initial steps to help rebalance that power differential.",labor
"But gig workers need protection too, and that's why we support Pay Up. We believe that the principle that every worker should be paid enough to pay their bills, nourish their families, and especially when they're hospitality workers. With good economics, we're all better off when the people who make, serve, and deliver food can afford food themselves.",labor
"Hello, I am Carmen Figueroa with the Pay Up campaign. Gig industry executives have made millions of dollars in personal profits off my labor and have no intentions of investing in me or any of their workers. Their lobbyists on this call will make outlandish claims to justify paying gig workers some minimum wages.",labor
"These lobbyists will derail equity conversations with ridiculous debates and demands to delay equity with useless studies. Their talking points, created by app lawyers, are designed to pit minority small businesses against gig workers of color. Expanding pay models for gig workers makes social economic equality a reality and not just a campaign slogan.",labor
"Common sense and not a study is all that is needed to understand when workers get paid more, they spend more in their communities. The council's time would better be studying what hurts small businesses as app executives transferring more and more profits to themselves, sniffing away cash from communities. For those who find themselves at the top of the financial pyramid, it costs nothing to provide equity for those holding them up for below.",labor
All the Pay Up policy will do is elevate the margin of life. I am trusting lawmakers to pass the Pay Up policy for gig workers because we are not disposable and should not be exploited. Thank you for your support.,labor
"The sharing economy has provided critical, flexible work opportunities for millions of Americans and thousands right here in Seattle. The ordinance before you creates the potential for additional barriers to entry for these earners and may ultimately drive down the flexible earning opportunities available to them. Our effort-based approach at SHIPS allows for shoppers to work as little or as much as they want and in a way that suits their individual needs.",labor
"It's worth noting that 75% of our shoppers choose to work less than 10 hours a week for SHIPS, and last year SHIPS shoppers made, on average, between $25 and $35 per hour when factoring in offer pay, bonuses, and tips. Delivery app-based work involves many nuanced factors in order to ensure the system works for both our customers and our shoppers. There have been no attempts to study the economic impacts of this measure, which risks economic uncertainty and risks the flexible work opportunities shoppers in Seattle value.",labor
"Brian. Hi, my name is Brian Rodriguez, and I am a Dasher based in Seattle. I am working to save enough to go back to school without having to depend on my parents and family.",labor
"All of us are going through a hard time right now, especially with the pandemic, rising gas prices and inflation, but Dashing has made it possible to remain financially free, all while making it to class on time. Not having to choose between my education and making money has made these uncertain times easier, and I want to stay that way. I stand before you today because I worry that the current pay up proposal is problematic.",labor
"If we're trying to pass a proposal to help Dashers, I'd want to know that our legislators have done everything necessary to make sure it actually does end up helping us, not hurting us. I ask the city council to take more time to study pay up so that you better understand the consequences of the proposal before passing it. Thank you so much.",labor
"Hi, my name is. Hi, my name is Joel Shapiro and I'm one of the co founders of dumpling and also a member of the Labor Standards Advisory Committee here in Seattle. It's no secret that the gig economy is broken, low pay, no flexibility, no transparency and no opportunities for people to take control of their own work.",labor
"We need new business models to fix it, and also new policies to ensure workers have basic protections. That's why my co founders and I started dumpling, and it's also why I support the pay up policy being considered by city council. Technology has the potential to deliver a unique degree of flexibility, along with meaningful transparency and fair pay.",labor
"But that's not what workers experience on apps like Instacart and DoorDash. In fact, more often than not, technology and the gig economy is being used for the exact opposite. Instead of transparent and fair pay, pay rates are determined by constantly changing algorithms designed to go as low as the company can get away with.",labor
"Instead of flexibility to decide which jobs are actually worth taking, workers are pitted against each other in a race to immediately accept or lose job offers. Workers are left to cover all of their own expenses and left to hope for tips in order to make any money. I've heard from workers on these apps for years as we've been building dumpling right here in Seattle.",labor
"Our aim is to use technology to flip the gig economy on its head by creating a true ownership model for workers. And while our team is dedicated to making our ownership model succeed, it's not enough. There will always be other companies in the market, and if they're not guided by a mission to equip workers with proper pay and supportive tools and transparency, workers will pay the price.",labor
"And that's exactly what we've seen over these past few years. The gig economy has a ton of promise to provide people the flexible access to income they need, but it also has a ton of downside, especially when it's out of balance like it is now. Although businesses like Dumpling are helping to provide meaningful opportunities to workers, we need policies like PayApp to move forward to ensure workers don't bear all of the costs when companies fail to step up.",labor
"My name is Allison Ford, and I am the public policy manager for Uber in the Pacific Northwest. As we have testified in the past, Uber is supportive of an earnings standard and welcomes the opportunity to partner with the City Council and all stakeholders to develop a legislative solution. However, this current bill needs significant amendments in order to address what will certainly be widespread unintended consequences impacting small businesses and the work opportunities of platform drivers.",labor
Among our many concerns are the overall high cost of the earnings standard formula and lack of research to truly measure what impact this will have on the community and the economy. This bill is also lacking basic guardrails to protect against potential fraud that is a well-known problem throughout our industry. We implore this committee to please take the time to fully consider the amendments and the policy recommendations that have been brought to your attention before moving forward with passing this bill.,labor
"My name is Khadain Beyane. I'm a member of PayApp. I have experience with a lot of companies in the gig industry like Amazon, Uber, Lyft, as well as Instacart.",labor
"There is no good regulations, especially when it comes like a labor job. The one is governed by employee and employer, as well as big companies with independent contractors. So the city, as well as other governmental organizations, they should have a strong policy regarding this kind of rules, because the big or gig companies, they just make billions of dollars while each individual independent contractors, they make less than minimum wage.",labor
"So in order to keep up with the living standard of the day-to-day, what we see right now, the inflation and other factors, people, they cannot even afford to live because minimum wage, the word explaining, it doesn't make sense. People, they have to make a living income. So in order to make a living income, governments has to have, as well as independent contractors and gig workers, they have to have, on the same platform, they have to have access.",labor
"And also, the government has to put a cap on the margins of these gig companies because they're independent contractors to make a living and then also to have a stable economy for the country. Thank you. Thank you.",labor
"Hello, my name is Maria Hernandez. The people working for business are not the ones doing, we are the ones shopping for dog food, picking up from restaurants and taking to customers, driving around the block two or three times because we can't find parking lot. That time, and gas, DoorDash is not paying for that, has to come out of our pockets.",labor
"We are not earning what the apps claim we are earning. We need to, this policy now, we can't wait for the gig app working, for the pay app policy. Thank you so much.",labor
"Hi, I'm Michelle Thomas with the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance here to support pay up to eliminate sub minimum pay for gig workers in Seattle, and to thank you Councilmember Herbold for your leadership on this important policy. There's an undeniable link between wages and our state in cities, affordable housing and homelessness crisis. People cannot afford the sky high rents in Seattle in the greater region.",labor
"We hear a lot, gig workers who are facing the impossible situation of uncertain income and pay that is far too low to meet their housing costs. Everyone needs and deserves a safe, healthy and affordable home, and every worker needs and deserves the security of a minimum wage for their work. I urge you to support pay up and to not weaken the policy with company driven amendments that would lower pay, create loopholes or exclude workers from basic protections.",labor
"Hi, greetings, everyone from the hearing. My name is Wei Lin, and I work for GoPub since February 2020. As a gig worker myself, I really need to pay our policy tax.",labor
"At the beginning of the year, GoPub has been continuously changing the method of pay very often without no reason, and had a huge impact on drivers' income on each order drivers have done. They took away guaranteed pay shift blocks that cut our earnings tremendously without the minimum pay for the drivers. Also, the new system they are using right now only send out one bag at a time, so most drivers have increased their mileage and gas costs on the cars but not earned worth it.",labor
"Because GoPub stretched their delivery zone for more business and increased delivery fees for customers and third party apps. But drivers still earn less and less on each bag orders because we mostly only run out with one single bag and for one round trip. When we're working with GoPub, we have to clock in the warehouse and wait for our turn.",labor
"There's a line of drivers waiting. Sometimes it could take up more than 90 minutes waiting for just one single order, and those times we are waiting are not covered but at our own risk. There are different times of the day that can affect drivers' income, so it is very important drivers can make even minimum rate on each single trip or round trips that will really help the drivers.",labor
"For those who stay, geek drivers are also hard-working people. We risk our safety and health during the night and day. Most of us are actually doing double the overtime during the pandemic by not receiving PSAT properly because the big corporations like GoPub think they can manipulate drivers so easy and control our rightful income to make their business going well.",labor
And we have some concerns that are related to the Seattle payout proposal. Just a couple of them is our concern on flexibility. A lot of our members have two jobs.,labor
"They do driving after they run their businesses. And they have to have the flexibility in order to pick up the kids and just do all the things that's associated with running a family and the management of a small business. A 200% minimum wage increase, as written, would just hurt small business.",labor
"Perfect. Okay, perfect. So I'm Michelle, and I am full time with Instacart, and it is my only gig.",labor
"And I want to say first thanks to everyone on the council for kind of spending the last year listening to us and our concerns and, you know, supporting us in this policy. I just, you know, gig companies have a long history of exploiting their workers. They use the independent contractor label to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, benefits, wages, while we, the shoppers, the workers, drivers, are the company of the state.",labor
"We are the company. We directly impact their revenue and the customer satisfaction. Not only do we carry the burden of expenses, we also really don't have a say in our work.",labor
"I know that they keep saying flexible, but we don't get to determine what orders we see, and we are pitted against each other. And those algorithms determine where we shop, when we shop, how we shop. We really don't have any control.",labor
"And I know, while I respect the concern for, you know, what the impact of this policy could be, you know, we and you need to consider the full impact on everyone and not just the small business sector. An investment in workers means an investment in the local infrastructure, local businesses, families. None of these companies have any investment in our city or the people in it.",labor
"These apps are a third party, which means they're a middleman. A middleman in charging the businesses they quote unquote support and pay minimally to those that directly impact their profit. Passing this policy will not only, will not harm customers or businesses.",labor
"It will just fall under a different umbrella. And also an alternate pay method that some of these gigs are kind of coming up with, they aren't going to work. In the past, there's been issues with transparency changes were made.",labor
"And slowly, I've watched just in the last year or two, with those kind of transparencies go away. This policy allows the worker to be able to track their earnings and know that they're getting paid honestly. And that's what we need.",labor
"I have been a part of the stakeholder meeting from the beginning and I think Councilmember Herbold and her office for making us a part of this. I want to say this message is really for all the gig workers that are listening and will listen. Our members out there that I've been speaking to, that who is being pitted against as Drive Forward and the companies and Pay Up, we're being pitted against each other.",labor
"But the fact is laws are very serious business and they should be created, brought up with emotion, but then created and implemented with data. And just to make sure that we are not unintentionally creating a worse scenario for the gig workers. Every stakeholder agrees that delivery workers do need attention.",labor
"Good afternoon. My name is Jack Sorensen and I'm here on behalf of Civic Ventures to share our support for pay up legislation. Look, the usual cry wolf claims about stronger wages hurting businesses are as inaccurate as they always are.",labor
The last couple of years have been a boon time for gig companies. They are raking in record profits while paying subminimum wages. We wouldn't allow any other employer in the city to get away with this.,labor
"But we have a system that has allowed gig companies to exploit people in our city to maximize their profits. Not only is this morally reprehensible, it's also terrible for our city's economy. And terrible for the very small businesses like restaurants that these gig companies and their representatives claim to support.",labor
"For every dollar these companies take from the people who work for them, that's $1 less spent at local restaurants or coffee shops, at the consignment store or movie theater or tire shop. Gig companies like DoorDash, Instacart, Uber, Postmates, GoPop and others are effectively siphoning money out of Seattle's economy and delivering it to their CEOs and shareholders. It's at the expense of workers and families as well as small businesses throughout the city.",labor
"Passing pay up won't just benefit workers, it will benefit Seattle's economy and small businesses. Because when workers have more money in their pockets, they spend it at local businesses. Businesses make more and in turn hire more workers to meet the demand.",labor
"We work to ensure that all Americans benefit from technological leaps. We urge opposition to the pay up proposal. We think this is well-intentioned to help delivery drivers and gig service providers afford the rising cost of living in Seattle, but will ultimately lead to higher delivery and service costs, which in turn will mean higher costs for Seattle families and fewer orders for drivers and gig workers.",labor
"We want to see livable wages for those in Seattle. But because this proposal sets such a high hourly wage, services that help families like grocery delivery, meal delivery, and dog walking will all see prices increase in order to afford the increased wage. We encourage the City Council to set this ordinance aside until an economic impact study can be done to understand the full impact of this type of legislation.",labor
"Talisha will be followed by Rich Morris. Hi, this is Talisha Harold. I am a Seattle gig worker and I am testifying on behalf and in support of the pay up.",labor
"Gig companies like DoorDash and Instacart claim that paying gig workers more will result in the price of services increasing for customers. These gig companies claim to be especially concerned about the impact this will have on seniors, people with disabilities, and low income customers that rely on the services. This is a flawed premise for two important reasons.",labor
"One is that customers are essentially paying gig worker wages. And many of those customers are the same populations that these gig companies claim to be so concerned for. Seniors, people with disabilities, and low income customers.",labor
"Gig companies are often paying as low as $2 a job and are allowing the customers to supplement worker pay with their tips. So when these companies claim workers make $27 an hour, well, most of that is the result of customer tips. A worker should not need to depend on tips to earn a fair wage.",labor
"Without customer tips, pay for these jobs would certainly be subminimum. Many gig workers can show you from their pay documents that 50% or more of their pay is from tips. The second flaw of this premise is that it completely ignores the fact that many seniors, people with disabilities, and low income folks are also gig workers.",labor
"So these companies aren't even recognizing that folks from these communities are making up a large portion of their workforce. The workforce that makes the success of these apps even possible. If these companies care for seniors, people with disabilities, low income customers, wouldn't they want to acknowledge that they make up a sizable portion of their workforce?",labor
"And wouldn't they want to express their concern for their financial well-being by paying seniors, people with disabilities, low income folks, or for their workforce a fair and equitable wage? We don't need more data to know they need to pay the fair share. Thank you so much, Talisha.",labor
I had a stroke 12 years ago. Crucial for me to be able to do DoorDash because it's the only job I can do. I need to be able to make a fair wage while doing it.,labor
"Apologies for the technical difficulties earlier. My name is Tiffany Alvidrez, and I'm the Western Region Policy Manager for Instacart. Instacart continues to be opposed to CB 120294, the pay-as-legislation.",labor
"We remain very concerned that these ordinances threaten access to vital services for local businesses, including Seattle-area grocers and other brick-and-mortar retailers. We also have some concerns around the lack of transparency in this public process to pass this ordinance. Twenty-five amendments were presented to the Council by central staff at the hearing last week, but not every proposed amendment, including those proposed by Instacart, was presented for public discussion.",labor
"We respectfully request the Council extend this process to make the time necessary to study the potential impacts, as well as consider a number of amendments, such as replacing the current per-minute per-mile formula with a minimum earnings standard of at least 120% of minimum wage, and ensuring this minimum focuses on covering only independent contractors and not W-2 employees, who are already covered by city and state wage and hour laws. Thank you for the opportunity to publicly raise some of the tenets of Instacart's counterproposal. We will continue to remain engaged in this process.",labor
"My name is Jason. I'm a successful full-time Instacart shopper, occasional Doordasher, and West Seattle resident. Immediately after I'm done speaking, I'm going to send you a more detailed email.",labor
"I please beg you to take the time to read it. I worked very hard to become a successful shopper, and the pay is fantastic. I used to struggle for 20 years to pay off some debts, and six months after becoming an Instacart shopper, they were paid off.",labor
"I moved out of my slum of an apartment to a beachfront apartment on Alki, and I bought my dream car. This is a fantastic opportunity for those with the right skill. If you'll think back before the pandemic, these gig-based apps were fully accepted as mere side hustles with the potential to possibly make some extra income in one spare time.",labor
"There's no interview, no qualifications. Anyone with a car and smartphone has access to try these opportunities, but that does not mean everyone will succeed. Instacart in particular requires a certain level of focus, skill, and self-motivation.",labor
You can't check your email or social media. You must be fully engaged. I've never heard any of these gig companies so much as insinuate that they're offering a full-time alternative to traditional employment.,labor
I'm a gig worker. Gig apps are a new industry brought forth by the technology and out-of-the-box thinking. It is wrong to try to stuff them into old models of employment.,labor
"New ways of thinking need to be applied when discussing legislature. To me, Instacart's like a middleman or a broker, connecting buyers with those willing to shop and deliver. I've checked my earnings against order fees placed by someone I know.",labor
"Instacart can't take more than a dollar or two. The lion's share of the profits go to us already. You know, the ride-giving apps are different than restaurant apps and different than personal shopping.",labor
My name is Jonathan Thompson. I'm a member of the Transit Riders Union and a gig app customer. I'm here to urge you to pass the payout policy.,labor
I am not able to work. I live on disability. And I also get support from my parents.,labor
"My disability makes grocery shopping impossible. So I rely on Instacart for my groceries. I often wonder, are these workers paid enough?",labor
"As a customer, I can't tell how much Instacart charges so little up front for the service. But as a customer, I can't tell how much Instacart workers take home. I always try to tip well, but I never know if it's enough.",labor
"As someone who relies on gig delivery services, it would help my conscience to understand that a driver is already making a living wage with what they're receiving from the company. I would also like to say that I don't think it's a good idea to pay individual customers to make sure gig workers have a decent living wage. And I also think it's silly that some of these gig companies are touting their take-home average pay, because that clearly doesn't cover people on the bottom end of the average.",labor
"Or on the costs and taxes that are borne by the gig workers. I would also like to say that during the $15-an-hour wage campaign, the Chamber of Commerce cried about how worker wage increases would kill business. And I think we can all see this has not been the case.",labor
"Please pass the pay-up policy. Thank you. Thank you, Jonathan.",labor
"My name is Kevin Bolt, and I'm one of many Seattle-area gig workers who have experienced the ups and downs of the gig economy. I started with deliveries with DoorDash and Postmates with mixed success, and I switched over to Instacart and have made much more respectable income as a gig type of income to supplement my full-time job. I've recently changed jobs.",labor
"I've actually found a job that works well with my gig income, but I still see and have been witnessing the frustrations of my fellow delivery workers and our exasperation and frustrations with the way that Instacart and other gig apps or delivery apps are actually operated. I've experienced a lot of frustration with the way that the gig economy works. I've experienced loss for interactions, attempting to resolve problems, a lack of transparency is a really big issue, and I feel very passionate about addressing the council to consider passing this proposal because we really need protections.",labor

"I don't know if the council is aware, but back in 2021, in February, the FTC ordered Amazon to pay out $61.7 million of money of tips that they would have from the gig worker. And I received money from this settlement, and it was very astonishing and disappointing that somebody you work hard for, that you contract with, that would do something, withhold money and pay for you. And this really creates, for me personally, a lack of trust and transparency.",labor
"So when I hear representatives from DoorDash and Instacart say that the average worker is making over $28 an hour, me personally have never gone close to making that much. I discovered gig work when I was let go of a full-time job, and it allowed me to make some money to help pay the bills and not put the burden on my wife to meet all our financial needs. I heard the gentleman from DoorDash mention that these gig apps create flexibility, which I 100% agree with.",labor
"It allows us flexibility to spend time with my family, to go to functions of my nieces and nephews that a normal 9-to-5 wouldn't allow. They want to label us as independent contractors, yet we have no say. We cannot negotiate our pay.",labor
"We have to accept what they offer, and that could go down from one day to the next, even from one order to the next order. So I am in support of the pay-up campaign just to bring transparency and fair pay. I hear them say that this is not meant to be a full-time job.",labor
"It's a supplement income. Whether that's true or not for each individual, fair pay should be fair pay no matter the... Thank you so much.",labor
"Sorry about that. I'm Kimberly, gig worker. I support pay-up legislation.",labor
"I'm also very adamant about keeping my flexibility. And I'm happy to see that pay-up not only protects what flexibility I have, but increases it. I sat in stakeholder meetings all last year.",labor
"The gig companies were encouraged to participate. They had plenty of time to request changes in the policy, study the situation, and get ready for the changes on their back end. Many chose instead to wait until the last minute to blast out misleading propaganda in order to defeat this very reasonable policy.",labor
"I've heard the scare tactics about gig workers losing work, when in actuality, they won't have to work overtime anymore just to pay their bills, thereby leaving more jobs on the table for other workers. I've heard them threaten to raise prices, when in fact, they've made huge increases in profit throughout the pandemic while lowering our pay. There is plenty of money to go around.",labor
"The problem is simple distribution. Pay gig workers reasonable compensation before raking in record profits, and then everybody wins. I've heard them blatantly say that it wouldn't be equitable for people of color and immigrants, etc.",labor
Not like the current boondoggle which siphons off money from our local community to send out of state. They act as if we're greedy for at least wanting the same protection as all the other workers in this state enjoy. A minimum wage is not an unreasonable ask.,labor
"Finally, they want to study it. We already know the economic impact as gig workers have studied it for years, asking for more studies a straight out stall tactic. Don't let them pull the wool over your eyes, pass pay up, it's the right thing to do.",labor
"I wanted to speak to the citation about the idea that workers are somehow making $28 an hour because I think there's and that sounds like a lot and I think it would be quite a surprise to a lot of workers you've been hearing from for the past year plus, because they're not making that much money. First of all, you know door dashes minimum rate currently is $2 a job, that's $2 regardless of time, miles, etc. And so how then to understand that where that $28 number comes from and you know, first of all it's stated as an average rather than a minimum and setting that aside.",labor
"It's really important to keep in mind, you know, people have said already that that number includes tips and does not account for any expenses and shifting those expenses to workers is such a big part of the entire problem of how the gig economy is currently working. You just think about payroll taxes and mileage expenses and you're already talking, even if that $28 number or an accurate one, we're already talking about less than minimum wage in terms of what people are getting paid after expenses, which is why you've been hearing about this issue from workers for more than a year. You know, and that's the kind of reason why I pay like this is why door dashes number 12 on the list of companies in Washington State with the largest number of workers on food stamps.",labor
"And doordash is also number 18 on the list of companies with the largest number of workers in Washington State on Medicaid, Uber again number nine similar ranking. And you know our survey of thousands of workers showed really similar kinds of impacts like this of low pay that, for example, 64% reported they had less than $100 in their bank accounts at some point in the past year. 36% reported they've been unable to afford groceries or other basic household items.",labor
"And so, finally, just the idea that minimum pay of minimum wage after expenses for your time is too high is absurd because we know what happens when we raise pay it means more people have more money, which means more customers to spend to local businesses and it's a win win. Our last speaker that we have listed that is showing as present is Melissa bees was Melissa. Hi, my name is Melissa was, and I'm currently a gig worker.",labor
"I'm a full time driver for Uber and left, and I've done this for the last six years. Some people might not agree, like, I oppose having minimum wage. I don't want to cap, and I signed up to be a driver so I can work full time and be my own boss is why I signed up and last year during the pandemic was the biggest income profit that I've made with the whole time I've been with Uber.",labor
"So to say that we're underpaid. I don't agree with that statement, because I do feel that we get a fair amount. And I don't want to cap on my pay.",labor
"I've picked up a lot of regulars for years, I have a very good rapport with my customers. And I do feel that I'm adequately paid. However, I do feel that we do deserve to have benefits far as workers comp and I don't agree with it being postponed, because we are risking driving every single day and making sure that our passengers are getting safely to their destination.",labor
"Every single day we're in traffic. And I felt that we do do a good job for the community out there, and that we are fairly paid. So I'm asking the council to consider putting a cap on our pay.",labor
I usually just do in home sitting services because it works best for my schedule. I work a full time job on the side. I love the flexibility that Rover has allowed me to choose the customers with them before and choose my own race and it helps me earn supplemental income because we all know Seattle is very expensive.,labor
"And I'm sharing my concerns today because I think it would impact me. And for me this flat rate that I said is a comfortable rate for me and my clients, I usually just rotate between the four clients that I have in Seattle and I feel like it's a fair way to protect myself and my clients, and I urge the council to change the bill to protect my choices method. Thank you so much for hearing me.",labor
"Uh, and I'm also hearing that the staff at card kingdom in Ballard are on their pathway to unionization. And I I'm very excited to hear more updates when they're available. Uh, and just hope that this, this comes to fruition, very proud of the workers in Ballard.",labor
"So solidarity with the student and worker walkouts happening on Friday, November May 13th. Young people especially know that we need a new party, a party for the working class to fight both economic exploitation and further advance the union movement and to fight against attacks such as this. Thank you.",labor
"Of course, fundamentally, we need a workers' party that's willing to fight for working-class people and doesn't have to be pushed into action and begged for 50 years. Our next speaker is Sonja Ponath. Hi, it's Sonja Ponath.",labor
"That's why we need a real party for ordinary people. We know how to win things because we call for social movement. We call for rallies, protests, and walkouts to demand our rights, to decide what's best for ourselves and our bodies.",labor
"But then we saw, with the right-wing attacking union members, that right-to-work spread from state-to-state to nationally through the Janus decision. So it's clear that attacks on working people and working women, that none of us are safe anywhere without building a movement to fight back. As Martin Luther King said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice anywhere.",labor
"This is the only way that we can really defend this attack, is by building a powerful movement in the streets. And we need student walkouts, worker strikes. We need mass rallies.",labor
Because there is a very determined current of right-wing that is pushing for this. That is why in addition to mass protests we need mass workplace action. We need militant workplace action.,labor
"And we need non-violent civil disobedience actions as well. And all of those actions should also begin a conversation about the need for what kind of political party working people need. And in my view working people need a new party that will fight against this kind of oppression like sexism, homophobia, and transphobia, and attacks on people of color especially racism against the Black community.",labor
And we need a party that will actually stand with rank-and-file workers both union and non-union in order to put forward not only the labor struggle inside the workplace but for the labor movement to stand up in solidarity against these kinds of attacks. Thank you. Thank you Council Member Sawant.,labor
"And in fact, public transit has been more than a month in the open air drug market. And the city and city union paid to get off shift. 30 minutes early.",labor
"First of all, I've seen at least correctly if I'm wrong in a long time, a real resurgence of labor and unionization. I mean for a while there I was worried back in 15 and 16 like you know where's labor at now what's, what's going to happen in this gig economy, how are we going to, you know, galvanize and have labor unions and unions and have real, you know, not just you know just straightforward talking how we get these things done. And I know both of you have been working on a lot of these issues.",labor
"Currently, any violations of RIO are subject to, excuse me, any violations or failure to comply with RIO are subject to cumulative civil penalties of $150 per day for the first 10 days of a violation, and then $500 per day for each day thereafter. The proposed amendment would exempt violations of these new provisions from that scheme and instead subject them to a lower level of violations. So we're looking at $500 for the first violation and $500 for the first violation and up to $1,000 for each subsequent violation within a three-year period.",labor
"I should mention they often drive their own trucks and they're paid absolutely poverty wages. In fact, they're the crisis that they've been in has been a longstanding one. In fact, the teamsters have wanted to organize them, but it's been filled with obstacles because of the independent contractor designation.",labor
I want to highlight last week I had the chance to speak with folks across the country and national partners that are working on labor standards and protecting workers through the Local Progress Economic Justice Advisory Table. They are on the cusp of releasing a new report that is focused on workers' rights that can be promoted at the local level. This is especially important as we think about the ways in which local jurisdictions have been able to spearhead labor standard policies in cities and counties and to be able to see those take wave across the country.,labor
"Anna. Hi, my name is Anna Powell, and I represent DoorDash. We are here today opposed to the payoff ordinance.",labor
"DoorDash has supported minimum earning standards before, but the payoff proposal calculated at 200% of Seattle's minimum wage before tips for an average delivery is just too hot. It would raise costs on customers by up to $5, reduce orders for merchants, and shrink earning opportunities for dashers, who currently earn $28 an hour on average. We are disappointed to see erroneous claims about dashers in Seattle, and we believe it is important to set the record straight.",labor
"A recent report from Working Washington is based on data from just 400 deliveries across multiple platforms. That can't possibly summarize the experience of the other 38,000 dashers in Seattle. Finally, dashers doorDash has heard from more than 15,000 of your constituents who have submitted letters asking you to halt the payoff proposal and study its impact before passing it.",labor
"I'm the gig economy organizing director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and I'm here to comment on 120294, specifically amendments two and three. We urge the council to pass the ordinance with the exception of amendments two and three, which redefine marketplace companies and exclude thousands, potentially more domestic workers from the basic protections enshrined in this ordinance. Companies are attempting to exclude some of the most disadvantaged workers in the gig economy in order to maintain control while keeping their costs low.",labor
"The National Domestic Workers Alliance is the nation's leading voice for the 2.5 million domestic workers who make all of their jobs possible, many of whom live in Seattle. We strongly urge the council members to oppose amendments two and three in order to maintain the integrity of this budget. The attempts to redefine marketplace companies are part of the standard playbook for these companies.",labor
"Excluding marketplace companies from this legislation would only hurt workers like me workers providing real and necessary services throughout the city. It opens a loophole for gig work apps and sends the message that workers using these apps aren't deserving of the same rights and protections as anyone else. TaskRabbit may be a marketplace app, I am able to set my own rates, but TaskRabbit strongly suggests starting rates that are far below living wage and ethically out of line with other service providers in the city.",labor
"Additionally, the app actively encourages taskers to undersell themselves in an effort to compete with other taskers. They have little motivation to ensure that we're charging our worth. The lower we charge, the more attractive the app becomes to people seeking our services.",labor
Expecting that these apps profit margins is not a solution. We need the city to show that they value our lives over the profits of these large companies. We need this to be passed in as robust a condition as possible.,labor
"Hello, my name is Fox Matthews, and I am here to comment on the pay up proposal. I'm a dasher in the Seattle area. I'm also a local artist and a brand new father as of four months ago.",labor
And it's because of those two reasons I mentioned. I really appreciate and value the gig work such as DoorDash. It provides me the opportunity to reach my financial goals.,labor
It gives me the freedom to manage and create my own schedule and the flexibility to spend time with my family and pursue other endeavors. School is on the horizon and I know DoorDash will be an excellent tool to help me meet my goals. I'm also here today because I'm concerned about the pay up proposal.,labor
"I asked the city council to take time to understand the potential consequences this pay up proposal will have on many dashers, including myself. Thanks for your time. Thank you, Fox.",labor
"Greetings. My name is Wei, and I work for GoPub as your partner since 2020. And I need a pay up policy for my understanding.",labor
"I strongly oppose any amendment that will allow a company to exclude payment for engaged time spent on offers that we complete. Partners like us who are still willing to work during pandemic are hard workers that don't want to lose our job to any income by trying to defraud the company. We want to do a good job and complete the job as fast as we can, as civil as we can, as safely as we can.",labor
"We hope that if we do our best, we'll be rewarded. But if the company are worried about fraud, they can address it by penalizing or determining a worker from fraud. This is what GoPub does already.",labor
GoPub tracks the miles and time of drivers driving on GPS. And the driver apps always force us to turn tracking locations. They know how long the order and how long it usually takes to drive.,labor
"As the leader of the General Baptist Convention of the Northwest, we express our concerns with the pay up proposal before the city, Seattle City Council. We believe this legislation must be set aside to do the work of better understanding its impact to our communities that we work to connect and empower. For example, in 2017, prior to passing the sugar sweetened beverage tax, the city took the time to create the sweetened beverage tax racial equity toolkit.",labor
"The same should be done to assess the impact of the policy on ethnic business powers, app based workers and community members before rushing to pass it. The pay up policy doesn't take into account the complexities of app based work and the negative unintended consequences that could come from rush policy like the pay up. We believe there's a great opportunity to take it in a new direction.",labor
"Sage will be followed by Justin Hire. Sage? Hi, Sage Wilson with Working Washington here in support of the pay up policy after more than a year of hearings and work and in sharp opposition to the marketplace loophole amendments number two and three.",labor
"Amendment two would vastly expand the definition of marketplace. The companies like Rover, TaskRabbit and Handy would be able to offer on demand jobs and track workers but not have to pay accordingly, just because they may primarily do other things. And note that TaskRabbit already offers delivery at sub minimum rates.",labor
"Amendment three would entirely exempt these companies from the policy so they can continue using their control over access to jobs to drive down pay. Together, this would create a massive loophole that every other gig company would try to squeeze through, which is why pay up has always covered these workers who have been making the case at every hearing and included in every version of the policy before council since last year. These companies have not made any public case why their workers should not have rights because they can't.",labor
"Whether we're talking about domestic workers or farm workers or good workers, there's no good argument to be made about excluding anyone from basic protections like minimum wage. These last minute loophole amendments are bad policy unpopular and should be rejected. Thank you.",labor
"I'm the Director of Government Affairs for the Delivery Platform SHIPS. I'm calling to respectfully express our concerns with the Council Bill 1202-94 as drafted the ordinance risks economic uncertainty for the local sharing economy, which is a crucial source of earning opportunities for thousands right here in Seattle. This measure is being considered without and prior to any effort from the city to study the impacts, including the possibility that it diminishes the flexible earning opportunities available to app-based workers, as well as the number of delivery workers.",labor
"Flexibility is at the core of our effort-based approach at SHIPS. Many SHIPS shoppers use our platform as a way to earn side income to pursue the things they value in life. To this end, 75% of our shoppers choose to work less than 10 hours a week for SHIPS.",labor
"Who choose to work more than 40 hours a week earn on average more than $67,000 a year. Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to respectfully express our concerns with the ordinance. I would ask that you please heed the concerns brought up by companies as you consider this measure.",labor
"I'm a shopper on the Instacart app. I'm here to ask you to vote for the pay up policy and against the amendment to hide tips on offers. If gig apps are allowed to hide tips, it'll further their practice of stealing tips to pay a fair wage to workers.",labor
Tips are not wages. Workers are already in the dark about how Instacart determines how much a job will be paid. Hiding tips will turn the lights off completely.,labor
Here's the deal. Instacart is not paying minimum wage on a consistent basis. 60% of shopper earnings is tips.,labor
Knowing tip amount helps us know if Instacart's paying a fair wage. Tips are such a large portion of our total compensation that we decide what jobs to accept based on it. Every restaurant in Seattle is required to pay the minimum wage to workers before tips.,labor
These gig companies must be held to the same standard. It is the right of workers to receive fair pay before tips and to know the tip amount. Tips are not wages.,labor
"Good morning, Chair Herbold and members of the committee. My name is Tiffany Alvidrez and I'm the Western Region Policy Manager for Instacart. I'm here today to address CB 120294 pay up legislation.",labor
"Instacart is committed to providing shoppers with opportunities to earn how they want, when they want, all based on their individual goals and built around their schedules. But in order for those earning opportunities to exist, there must be sufficient customer demand. And any attempt to legislate their working conditions needs to factor that in.",labor
"We appreciate the amendments that have been introduced, but we think several important adjustments still need to be made. An impact study is still needed to truly determine the effects this bill will have on businesses, workers, and the community. The proposal remains extremely problematic for Instacart customers, shoppers, and retail partners.",labor
"Members of this committee should be aware that we fully anticipate a decrease in demand for the services offered on delivery network platforms, which will in turn lead to a decrease in earning opportunities for workers and an increase in cost for consumers. Instacart looks forward to further discussing as we continue to work. Thank you so much.",labor
"Yes, thank you. Hello, hey, my name is Carmen Figueroa, and I ask that the committee not allow companies to withhold any amount of payment for completed orders to prevent fraud. Even if the policy required companies to exclude time only if they have evidence of fraud, we all know how they operate.",labor
They would just use it as an excuse to pay drivers less keeping the profit for themselves. No other company is allowed to stop your pay if they think you're working too slow. Completing orders late is not an indicator of fraud.,labor
"There are countless reasons an order is completed late, but I would like to give you the top three. When an app is behind the process in offering orders to drivers, drivers will often receive orders after the order is due. The app calculates time and mileage as pro fly.",labor
"My name is Richard and I live in Arbor Heights, which is Councilmember Arbold's district. I'm a personal chef and my partner and I both work from home. We love dogs and have used Rover since 2018 to manage our pet sitting business, which we operate on the side.",labor
"I'm very worried that this proposal was created with only certain kinds of delivery services in mind and without significant amendments could hurt other types of service providers like the pet sitting and food delivery are very different. I provide a safe environment for pets over the course of days, not minutes or hours. And unlike delivery services, I have full control over what rates I charge when I advertise my services on Rover.",labor
"I've seen the proposed amendment to exclude market class eight marketplace apps from the pet policy after fighting for payouts. It's so disappointing, considering including 1000s of workers. It doesn't make sense to disenfranchise a group of workers who also rely on gig work, especially protection.",labor
"As a Rover walker, I'm allowed to set my own rates, but highly encouraged to keep them low in order to compete and be chosen before other workers, creating a dog eat dog world for workers. Rover takes 20% of our pay. We take on a lot of responsibilities and liabilities aren't realized as we are not just dog walkers.",labor
"To date, the council has yet to commission a study to vet the policy and determine the impact on community. Price hikes for every aspect of the app-based economy lead to fewer earning opportunities for drivers and orders from businesses that utilize the advantage of app-based platforms. We respectfully ask the council to pause and thoroughly study the proposal before moving forward.",labor

"Yesterday a customer showed me the campaign the Dashboard started in order to retaliate against the payoff campaign. This was just proof of our value to Dash.

I'm from Seattle. I was a paramedic and I got liver cancer and I was told I couldn't work again. DoorDash five years ago gave me the opportunity to support my family during this epidemic.,labor
"If I lose, I'm sorry. It's just I'm emotional because this job has saved me and my family from being homeless. I have to see doctors for my cancer constantly, but with DoorDash, I have the means to go see my doctor any minute.",labor
I could take a break if my doctor said there's a donor. Let's go. I don't have that opportunity with other jobs.,labor
"I mean, as all of us are going through this hard time right now, especially with this pandemic and the risings of gas and inflation, this job has done a lot for me. And I just I oppose against PAYA. I wish you guys would really consider evaluating it again.",labor
"So I just wanted to talk about my experience as a gig economy worker in Seattle. I've had a lot of different issues, but I'd like to stick to the ones that are relevant to the topics today. One big issue that I've had is that I haven't been able to get support to be transparent or for them to be able to listen to my feedback, and the platforms that I've been using are Uber Eats and Postmates.",labor
"The other issue that I had was just with the West Seattle Bridge. I remember I would get so many rides where I would, it just wouldn't be a very high payout because it would calculate it as if the bridge was open. And when I finally did the delivery, it'd only be like nine or 10 or 12 bucks and it'd be like a huge amount of distance.",labor
I've heard that story about bridge and app-based workers. Please do feel free to send in your testimony. Sorry for cutting you off there.,labor
"Hello. I live in Seattle and use delivery apps often as a person with severe asthma that is at risk due to the pandemic. All workers deserve to be paid a fair wage, including delivery drivers and gig workers whose work involves wear and tear on their personal vehicle.",labor
I support the pay-up policy and think you should prioritize strengthening the rights of gig workers. Tips are not wages. Companies should pay their workers at least minimum wage without exception.,labor
Charge me more fees. I don't care. I want my community members to be paid fairly.,labor
But I think it's entirely reasonable for these companies to dip into record pandemic profits to do the right thing. I support pay-up without amendments that help corporate interests. Thank you.,labor
"Hello. My name is Jean Callis. I'm a member of the pay-up campaign, a voter in District 4, and a driver for Grubhub.",labor
I'm here today to speak in favor of the pay-up policies before amendments and demand that council take action on it this year. I started working for Grubhub full-time at the beginning of 2022 after leaving my job due to a combination of burnout and developing chronic migraines. The flexibility offered by gig work seemed ideal at the time.,labor
"However, with inflation rising, the cost of necessities, as well as gas prices and vehicle maintenance, pay as it stands is no longer enough. On top of these expenses, we are responsible for paying federal taxes as both employee and employer, and that's doubling the tax on our income. I've heard the argument that if drivers simply worked enough hours, they would make enough to survive.",labor
I work between 40 and 50 hours a week. So what are enough hours if working full-time is not sufficient? We are not asking for outrageous wealth or making untenable demands of these companies.,labor
"Hi. My name is Becky Stanley, and I live in the 98118 zip code. I'm here to support pay up but not the loophole.",labor
"I'm a customer with a disability and a compromised immune system, and having Instacart is really helpful to me. But I'm not confident that people are being paid fairly. And I used to be a waiter back when minimum wage was they had a special waiter minimum wage.",labor
And our paychecks ended up being like $35. But we can't count tips as wages. Not everybody tips.,labor
"And I don't feel like I can use these services because there isn't transparency. I'm confused. I don't know who is getting paid properly, if I'm part of the problem.",labor
I don't want to be part of the problem. Pay up helps. Transparency.,labor
"I am obviously calling in about the gig app. And, you know, independent contractors, which we are, have the right to know the terms of a job prior to accepting. Hiding tips kind of violates that.",labor
"Instacart also has a long reputation for misappropriating tips. They have promised pay transparency after legal action was taken. And in the last year, I have literally watched that slowly go away.",labor
"They have stopped showing the breakdown of shoppers' pay. There is no beneficial reason for hiding tips or pay. And it can result in, you know, returning to using customer tips to subsidize pay.",labor
"The idea of whether or not workers are going to cherry pick orders or pad time is an absolute farce and unfounded. It is now that orders are being cherry picked because they need the tips to subsidize their pay. The gig app will ensure all orders are accepted promptly since orders will be accepted with confidence that the order isn't costing the worker any money, which is consistently a risk currently.",labor
"The fraud amendment, unacceptable. We need to be paid for all of our active time. Unforeseen circumstances happen.",labor
"Hi. I'm Marie. I'm calling through a sign language interpreter, and I work for Instacart.",labor
"I just wanted to share my experience. I know there's a lot of workers that work for Instacart, and they're hiring a lot of new workers who accept the new wages. When I started working for Instacart, it was good pay, but I've seen the pay get less and less over the years, and it's harder to pay my bills and allocate my money to what I need it to.",labor
"Thank you. Um, Good morning Council members, as you know, this morning the committee will be voting on amendments to Council bill 120294, which is a bill that establishes a minimum payment standard and related regulations for app based workers. We Have 16 amendments to present. Last",labor
"First amendment for your consideration is amendment one version to sponsor by charcoal herbal and Councilmember Lewis. This Was distributed last evening, it makes small technical changes and clarifications, including clarifying the definition of incentive clarifying the definition of unsealed. It Requires tip disclosure, if applicable, before facilitation of the offer rather than before completion of the offer. This",labor
"Is so the worker would have the information before deciding whether to accept the job or not. And It also changes the review period for canceled offers from saying quote three days to quote 72 hours. With That, I will turn it over to chair herbal. I'm",labor
"How does that so if you're the consumer. You Need to tip somebody before they provide the service. Why Would you do that before the service is provided, just want to understand that logic. Thank",labor
"Companies do allow a customer to put the tip amount before the offer is basically presented to the worker. So It would just be that first amount of, or the first kind of passive information. And So the current bill would require that if the customer provides that before the work is done, that the worker would be alerted to what that tip amount is. So",labor
"It's not additional an additional tip at the end. Yes. Can I follow up to clarify. Yeah,",labor
"Absolutely. So Then customers aren't required to, it's just, if the customer chooses to disclose it up front, then that information will be provided to the worker, but there's no requirement that they provide the tip up front, and it doesn't prohibit them from tipping So You could. So",labor
"If you're a customer you could do zero up front like hey why would I tip somebody if I haven't gotten service yet. You Put zero in for now, you get great service you're excited then you tip them at the end. But If you do choose to tip something in advance. That",labor
"Must that information must be passed through to the worker before they accept the job. Is That right, that is my exact understanding of the, of the intent. Thank You. Okay,",labor
"Thank you. Alex Anything to add. I Would just add quickly that not all apps allow up front tipping, and this does not require them one way or another it just, if the app does and if a customer chooses to do it up front, then the worker would be it may be required to view all of that up front tip. Thank",labor
"You so much will central staff, please describe amendment number two. Yes, The next amendment for your consideration is amendment to version one, it is sponsored by Councilmember Peterson. This Amendment would change the definition of marketplace network companies. The",labor
"Current bill would define marketplace network companies using two criteria. First, The companies are exclusively engaged in facilitating pre scheduled offers in which the customer and worker negotiate the offer scope and costs before the customer places the order, and the worker accepts. The Second criteria is that marketplace network companies exclusively facilitate services without monitoring offers by geographic location mileage or time. So",labor
"Amendment to would change the definition of marketplace network company to have three criteria. First, That a marketplace network company is primarily engaged in facilitating pre scheduled offers, in which the platform enables the customer and worker on the offer scope and costs before the customer places the order, and the worker accepts. The Second criteria is that the worker sets their own rates. And",labor
"The third criteria is that the network company does not monitor offers by mileage or time, but removes the reference to geographic location that's currently in the bill. The Use of primarily engaged rather than exclusively engaged gives the marketplace companies, more flexibility in their operations. For Example, while most while these companies typically offer pre scheduled work that is work that is will begin where the offer, sorry, where the worker will begin work within longer than two hours. Instead,",labor
This would allow them to sometimes do what we call on demand work which is within two hours. The Amendment would allow the Office of Labor Standards to define what primarily engaged would mean in this context and how it would apply. And With that we'll turn it over to Councilmember Peterson. Thank,labor
"I want to make sure we're being very careful not to stifle innovation and flexibility benefits to consumers workers and small local businesses. I Support a minimum wage for gig workers who have no say in their wages. At The same time, marketplace network companies who provide their brand, their customer base their computer application technology to workers who actually set their own compensation rates should be exempt from this experimental new law, so that we limit unintended negative consequences. These",labor
"You, Madam Chair, I actually have some questions for me gore. This Is a topic that I've been legitimately very undecided about over the course of our process of doing this work. You Know I got into this, this work with you on this area mostly because of the massive inequities I was very familiar with, and how the delivery apps operate, and how those delivery apps have passed a lot of expenses on to the people who, and the market really aware of, and have come to learn about them throughout this process. Because",labor
My primary area of interest here is in the extent to which these amendments from Councilmember Peterson would undermine our work on the delivery apps and create potential loopholes where delivery apps could reconstitute themselves to be a marketplace app and exempt themselves from the protections that we are passing in this bill. And I would just ask Amy on this. What Would be the impact of the primarily engaged versus exclusively engaged in terms of potentially opening that loophole. As,labor
"Would you have to do to become a marketplace app under this change definition, are we opening a risk to that. Yes. So To answer that question I think first I just want to caveat that it is difficult to game out all of the scenarios that could happen. You",labor
"Know with new legislation, but for your specific example of a company like door dash or something that does the on demand delivery. There Is a one of the sentences I did not read of the definition is that it specifies that on demand network companies and companies that primarily provide delivery services are not marketplace network companies. So I think no matter what criteria one, two, or one, two, and three are, it would be very difficult for a company like door dash that does that type of delivery work on demand to somehow change their business model to be a marketplace network company. For",labor
"Example, they would have to then primarily offer pre scheduled offers meaning that it would be outside of this two hour on demand window which is not really compatible with their business model. It Would again allow, they would have to allow their workers to set their own prices rather than the current kind of way that they offer offer a payment for a job, as well as they would have to stop monitoring workers by mileage or time. So I think that the three criteria plus that last sentence would make it more difficult for a company that currently does not operate in this way to change their business operation to meet this definition. Thank",labor
"Going to go ahead and ask a follow up question to Councilmember Lewis's question regarding enforcement, the word exclusive in the underlying bill seems to create a brighter line for enforcement than primary. So I'm wondering if OLS our Office of Labor Standards has weighed in on how this amendment would impact enforcement. And Then, Madam Chair while I have the mic. is whether or not we know if workers get any guidance from these companies on rates or get pressure or incentives to lower rates. One",labor
"Of the things that I heard about was well there might not be a direct engagement or dictating of rates placement of workers on an app and prioritizing certain workers over others depending on which gigs they accept or don't is is still prevalent among various platforms so I'm wondering if you can answer both of those questions. Yes. So Your first question we did receive feedback from OLS that they, they prefer the exclusively language, or in terms of kind of a bright line of yes or no, to help define what companies are marketplace network companies. Your",labor
Second question related to. I'm Sorry I just blanked on your second question. Whether Or not companies have certain strategies where they're maybe affecting whether or not a worker gets a gig or not based on the placement of that worker on an app or platform. Thank,labor
"You. I Apologize about that. Um, We have heard from workers that they do that the company does encourage them to set their rates at a certain level. I",labor
"Am not aware of any companies that currently use their algorithm to promote particular workers based on their based on their cost it seems to be more about ratings or the number of jobs that they have completed. However, You know again these are kind of algorithms or other technologies that could be changed to promote workers based on their rates fairly easily I would assume. So That is certainly an option for the companies. Thank",labor
You. A Quick question I have before we move back over to Councilmember Lewis. This Amendment in the changing of the definition of network companies. It,labor
Doesn't only affect the minimum compensation requirements correct it. If You fall out of the definition of marketplace or company you other elements of the bill that would not be a regulation that a company has to adhere to is that is that correct and can you just very quickly touch on on that that impact. Sure. So,labor
"Currently, the bill as presented or as introduced. It Has a definition for marketplace network company, and then some regulations which are specialized related to marketplace network companies. So For example, marketplace network companies because they do not track by geography, would not have to pay for engaged miles because they do not track how many miles, their workers are driving. So,",labor
"As the legislation is right now, changing this definition might put certain companies into or out of the marketplace network company definition, and then those specific marketplace network company regulations might apply to them. However, What I think you're referring to is if Amendment three passes, where they are excluded from Chapter 8 30.37, that would exclude them from both the minimum payment standard standard, as well as the flexibility requirements and the transparency requirements that are also included in the bill. And We can talk a little bit more about that under Amendment three as well if you like. Thank",labor
"You. Just A quick follow up on that. But If you, if you're, if you're, if you neither meet the definition of a marketplace network company, nor a on demand network company. You",labor
"Are. Yes, The, the network company is an umbrella term, and there are two subsets on demand and marketplace network companies. If You do not meet the definition of marketplace network company or on demand company, you are still considered a network company. If",labor
"You touched on that in the base bill here the base proposal that marketplace network companies are not tracking their workers, geographically speaking, but I believe this amendment alters that. Yes. So, In general, what we have heard is that the most marketplace network companies do not track their workers by geography so for example, usually with like DoorDash or Instacart, they are tracking their workers as they do the offer. However,",labor
"That is not necessarily the case for all of the marketplace network companies. There Is one particular geographic functionality in the rover app which allows a pet walker to share a map of the route that was taken on, for example, like a dog walk with the customer. After The walk is done. And",labor
"So, and that is placed on the, that is shared through the app so it's kind of a question of like how do you define geographic monitoring, but they requested that geographic monitoring be removed from the definition in order to allow that functionality, and not create any kind of like gray area. As It relates to that particular functionality on the rover app. Thank You. Member",labor
"Like to understand a little bit more about the geographic monitoring by a marketplace company, is there a way to tailor, something like that so I can understand maybe why a consumer would be excited to know where their dog was walk, for example, but that doesn't seem to be pertinent information for a company to track necessarily if the job is getting done truly by an independent contractor. You Think that that would be information shared between the client and and the worker or the provider of the labor so is there. Is There some nuance in like how that information could be provided to a purchaser of the labor versus having that information shared with the company or is this is this amendment just envisioning that that information is also shared with the company. My",labor
"Understanding is that the, the, the map for example is shared through the platform. However, It's not necessarily monitored by the company, they don't look at it. I Think they would have the ability to look at it but their current practice is to not look at that to see kind of where the Walker went, or to dictate the routes that they take in any way. So",labor
"So much. It's wanting To focus my comments on what we heard from the National Employment Law Project in their May 10 letter to counsel. This makes Good sense, both the marketplace network platforms and network companies defined in the bill, manage their businesses and their workforce. Both the",labor
"Marketplace network platforms and network companies defined in the bill, manage their businesses and their workforce with similar algorithmic based technology, and that technology can be reprogrammed comply with the bill letter goes on to say that historically the exclusions from and limitations on bedrock protections have excluded too many workers, particularly too many black and immigrant workers and maintaining the broad coverage is consistent with Seattle's commitment to race equity but also with the council's role, recognized in the bills preamble as a leader on wage labor and workforce practices that improves workers lives and supports and economic security and contributes to a fair and healthy and vibrant economy. You know, Again, I, I recognize the that there. I know What we don't know but we have a hard time imagining how existing on demand network companies could refigure their, their algorithms in a way to, or their, their models in a way to be defined as a marketplace network, but I have concerns even without imagining a new, a new business model I do have concerns, as expressed by Councilmember Mosqueda and as expressed by both our Labor Standards Advisory Committee and the Office of Labor Standards about the ability to, to enforce the, the concept of primarily and versus exclusively so I'm just want to flag, I too am intending to vote against amendment to remember Lewis. Thank you",labor
"Think the business model. Similarly gives Me this abiding concern that there could be unintended consequences in the other direction that the current definition could be over inclusive and cause strange results. I do Think that the round of questioning we just had about how the geographic location language interfaces for example with Rover walking the dogs as an illustration of the fact that I, I just keep having the abiding sense that we are inserting a regulation of the marketplace apps into primarily what is a delivery regulation on demand delivery regulation bill. That doesn't",labor
"Mean I'm opposed to doing something to to regulate the conduct of the marketplace apps I think there are things that have been raised or a stakeholdering that could warrant attention and legislation from the city that is bespoke and tailored to the inequities with the marketplace apps. I just Have a concern that there are places throughout the bill. Not just With the pay standard but with some of the flexibility and transparency requirements that just don't neatly apply to this category of business model. So, you",labor

So I Just want to make sure that I understand if this amendment passes what's potentially at stake, or on the to do list for Office of Labor Standards and if this is a question for central staff that's great or if Office of Labor Standards is watching and can get back to us that would be helpful to know, I guess, my understanding from hearing the analysis from central staff and looking at this amendment is that it could vastly expand the definition of marketplace loophole that the ability to track on demand jobs. The ability For Office of Labor Standards to understand whether and which type of jobs are supposed to be tracking could be nearly impossible it could be a barrier for enforcement requiring an assessment of the entirety of a company's offers before determining whether workers are being paid what they need. So, is,",labor
"Is there any sort of written analysis that Office of Labor Standards currently has in front of us that we could take a look to see if that assumption about whether or not this is creating a loophole, or whether or not this is meaning that companies could offer workers on demand work monitor the locations while performing the work and track the time they stop and start work, but not have to pay that is, is actually going to be a problem like these are the type of questions that I think actually undermine the intent or the heart of the bill and perhaps I am not seeing the same things that are less is or central staff or the co sponsors so I just want to make sure we have a full list of maybe what we're asking about what less before final passage on this bill if this amendment is to hang. Thank you. Yeah, um, I will work with OLS to get a more complete written response to you. Again, I",labor
"Asked them about the definition and they did express again that they prefer the exclusively rather than primarily as the primarily language requires them to kind of do some looking at the companies to say, for example, how many of your offers are pre scheduled versus on demand before determining whether a company would be a marketplace network company in a similar way we use the primarily engaged language and on demand, and the definition companies, and so OLS will also be having to look at companies that are on demand to ensure like how they will need to determine how much of that type of work means that they are that a company is either on demand or marketplace network company. So I Will continue I will work with OLS to get a written, a written response to your question about exactly, you know how much work they think that this would be compared to the existing definition. Thank you, Amy. There any",labor

Colleagues I Appreciate that there was a number of amendments we're all very interested in how they intertwine but with amendments number two and three hanging to this piece of legislation this is in fact not what office of labor and standards intended to analyze right I think there's a whole host of unintended consequences if folks want to use that term about how this may affect existing company behavior within this industry. And if",labor
"Office of labor standards is now in the process of having to look to see if each company is shifting behavior for the type of workers that they have. I think It's a whole nother set of policies that we might have to consider or let me rephrase that a set of resources that we might want to consider so that OLS has the capacity to actually do that analysis to thus provide us recommendations. I'm going To be voting yes on this amendment because I think it's important to get that data but again I think with the fiscal notes continuing to be a document that we need to point back to especially every year but especially in years like now, we need to have a better understanding of what the impact would be on office of labor standards so I would ask central staff to add this to their list. And again",labor

So, yes, I'd like to know more about what they see but I would want to make sure to be really clear with office of labor standards and amongst us in this committee that this is not actually I think part of what office of labor standards would do anyways because of the amendments two and three that were hung. I'll be Voting yes to get the information but I think that we need to have a clear understanding of what the cost will be. And with",labor
"First amendment is number five version, one, and this amendment would reduce the associated cost time and mileage factors, which are components of the minimum payment calculation as a refresher the minimum payment calculation is a per minute amount, which is the amount that is applied for each engaged minute, and then that is added to a per mile amount, which is per mile amount times, each engaged mile. So within That per minute amount, there is an associated cost factor and time factor which are the markups for the minimum wage equivalent rate, and within the per mile amount, the associated mileage factor is the markup for the IRS standard mileage So this Amendment would reduce all of those associated factors. The amount",labor
"Of these reductions are in the middle of what is in the draft legislation, and what is in the central staff memo in the list of amendments, and specifically the associated cost factor would be reduced from 1.13 to 1.12. The associated Time factor would be reduced from 1.21 to 1.17, and the associated mileage factor would be reduced from 1.25 to 1.10. The ultimate Result is that the per offer minimum amount for outpost workers would be less in 2022 the per minute amount would be reduced from 39 cents per minute to 38 cents per minute, and the per mile amount would be reduced from 73 cents per mile to 64 cents per mile. Thank you",labor
"Six. Yes, and Then mid six version one. This amendment Would change the Office of Labor Standards directors discretion to adjust the associated cost factor and associated time factor from annually to every three years. As a",labor
"Result, the associated cost factor and time factors would remain constant for at least three years. Thank you So much. Councilmember Nelson, Would you like to speak to this amendment as a sponsor? Yes, basically,",labor
"It took months and months of outreach and research and and and talking to stakeholders to come up with the in with the, the calculations that we have before us, and the, the discretion to revise and adjust every year seems like a lot of work for us to do on a continual basis and so basically this amendment simply gives three years instead of just one year for them to consider changes, and, and it also helps the the network companies because every as the OLS director proposes or in implements changes to the, to the underlying calculations, they have got to change their algorithms and in perhaps even signage etc because ultimately the, the minimum pay standard will change, so it helps those companies as well and then finally it also provides for more certainty and predictability in the marketplace, and that's good for the small businesses that rely on these, these app based services and the networks themselves and users and the drivers so that is why I put this forward and I did ask, we did touch base with OLS and they have no problem with this amendment.

Not seeing Any clarifying questions come from Nelson would you like to move the amendment. I move",labor

Just a Couple thoughts from me before I open it up, I'm supportive of this amendment legislation does not require the OLS director to assess the cost associated costs and time factors, it's allow it the amendment simply changes that discretion, every three years, and appreciate the amendment sponsor, clarifying that is not in conflict with OLS is hopes for administrating the legislation moving forward. Any other",labor
"Amendment for discussion is amendment seven version two. It is Sponsored by chair herbal and Councilmember Lewis, as discussed in the previous two amendments the legislation would give the director of the Office of Labor Standards, the authority to adjust the associated cost factor, and the associated time factor. However, it Does not provide the director with the authority to make adjustments to the associated mileage factor. If conditions",labor
"For workers change this amendment would grant that authority to the OLS director to adjust the associated mileage factor annually, and would provide guidance on factors to consider when making any adjustments. The only Difference is that it corrects a drafting mistake that I made by leaving in an incorrect reference to associated time factor rather than associated mileage factor. Thank you So much. Let's see",labor
"Associated mileage factor, what that is exactly. And you Want to take that. So the Associated mileage factor accounts for mileage that a, so the mileage that a worker drives while they are working on an offer is covered under the guaranteed minimum payment. So the",labor
"Mileage factor is kind of a multiplier to account for mileage that is driven before or after they begin their offers so for example, maybe a door dash driver takes a order to a location that is far away from any restaurants, and then after they are no longer being paid, they need to return back to an area where they will probably be doing the pickup so it is that kind of extra mileage that occurs before or after an offer. It's to Cover that type of mileage. Thank you. Thank you.",labor
"Are left to the OLS is OLS directors discretion outside of the scope of council approval so that's always been kind of a gripe of mine, but the thing about the, I guess I just always assumed that the associated cost factor that's associated with the, the mileage rate of point five eight would not change in, unless the IRS is rate changed and so my whole. I don't Believe that it's necessary to give the OLS director the discretion to change this. After all, The, the mileage factor is set by by the IRS, and, you know, in my opinion it is not reflective of the cars driven in this area and the costs associated with driving. So, I",labor

It would Also require that the notice of rights have a description of whether the network company identifies as an on demand network company, a marketplace network company or neither, and what the implications are for engaged time and miles. And it Would also require the network company to file their notice of rights with OLS. This amendment",labor
"Would ensure that a model notice of rights and accurate translations are available to the network companies and assist OLS with outreach and implementation by clarifying for app based workers what type of network company they likely work for, and I recognize that with the passage of amendment two and three, excluding marketplace network companies from coverage, we may need to adjust the language of the amendment, which we can do either now at the virtual table or we can kind of figure it out for full council. But that's The underlying description. Thank you, Jasmine. Really appreciate",labor
"Was requested by the Office of Labor Standards, who prefers to be doing the work to produce that model notice of rights and translations themselves. It also Removes the burden from the companies for having to pay for and providing this information. And I Understand that OLS and central staff have had conversations about the expenses associated with this amendment. And there",labor
"You're kind of scrolling down the amendment if you have in front of you I'll note that it contains a technical correction regarding tip disclosures that was included just in case amendment one didn't pass for some reason so that's what that's about. That's taken Care of because amendment one passed. And finally, This amendment would be adopted clarifying the disclosure of unsealed contents of online orders, so that OLS can work out the details on the manner and method of disclosure, which may need to, you know, may involve further details and with these type of companies, where the online order is not known in advance of the offer. And finally",labor
"This amendment would allow for additional information to be disclosed after an offer is already accepted instead of event in advance of the offer. And finally, This amendment would only apply to pre scheduled offers or offers containing multiple online orders, such as an offer for pre scheduled block of deliveries, and only if the company lacks advanced notice of that information. That information Would still need to be disclosed before a specific online order is assigned to a worker if it's reasonably ascertainable. The information",labor
"In question includes the number of engaged miles, any tips, and the names of businesses to be visited. And then The underlying draft also says applies to the physical labor required for the order and any unsealed contents. Thank you So much. This is",labor
"So people sign up for a shift, more in advance and, and they don't necessarily know what's going to be, you know, like in the vehicle when they are ultimately delivering it. So, you Know, it's not really fair to require that platform to divine and advance what's going to be in those packages or it's unnecessary unnecessarily logistically burdensome so this just reflects that in some cases. Different from Like food delivery apps where there could be an allergy situation or something like that, in, in an order that could pose an issue to the driver. So, you",labor
"Know, we're mostly talking about like sealed contents. You know Like Amazon flex style deliveries here, just to reflect that we're requesting certain information that they, they wouldn't have at a given time based on their model. Thank you. Member Lewis.",labor
"14 version one is sponsored by Councilmember Nelson. This amendment Would remove the tip amount from upfront disclosure requirements for each offer. As a Result, network companies would not be required to provide tip amounts when facilitating or presenting an offer to provide some more context for each offer. Due to",labor
The definition of how tips intersect with guaranteed minimum payment companies would not be allowed. If this Amendment passes to fold tips into the minimum payment that is part of the offer. So workers Would not be surprised to find that they actually don't get a tip because it's already been included in the offer. So I,labor
So the Whole policy rationale of this regulatory framework is to establish a predictable minimum wage. That is A living wage for drivers and. And if,labor
"This passes that is what we are, in fact, doing. And so, With the associated cost factors that we just approved by amendment. We're talking About if there are three trips that are 20 minutes long and five miles each in an hour that equals about $32 and 50 cents for 20 minute tips, and the whole reason for doing this is that is so that workers don't have to rely on tips for the lion's share of their payment from from working for these app based companies so. So that",labor
"Is, so that's what we're trying to do here, and requiring that the tip amount be shown up front does create the possibility and what we've heard from some stakeholders, the, the likelihood that there will be cherry picking amongst drivers who will be picking the, the, the trips that are that are highly tipped, and this then does create a customer consumer protection issue because that means it will be disproportionately impactful on low income people who can't afford tips are very high tips, or people, often the same folks who who order low priced things for delivery, you know, the fast food for example or whatever so. So I Do think that we have to take seriously the fact that this could negatively impact the consumers the customers that are using these applications so in any way. And aside From that, the way that tips are solicited and collected varies widely across the platforms, and the different and by different models so for example, many don't many of these applications do not ask for people, people assign a tip after delivery shift I believe is one of those companies where that's the case. And so",labor
"With this variation, and the difficulty perhaps of enforcing that kind of variation. I just Believe that, you know, the requirement for tip disclosure prior to accepting an offer is redundant and so for example dashers will always see the full customer tip as a separate line item after every delivery in accordance with the transparency requirements in this proposal. And that Is the case for other companies as well so this is this amendment is being offered for the benefit of the customers. And so",labor
"I do think that there is a lot of people in this room who could be left waiting a long time for people to accept their, their delivery, because there is no tip or the, or the, the item is so low price that the tip ends up being very small.

This is Really a piece of legislation broadly intended to provide additional clarification regulation for workers that are independent contractors should not an independent contractor, be able to choose the work isn't that the goal for them to be able to set their own rates especially if you know as amendment number three says, we're not even guaranteeing access to minimum wage for a subset of workers so if the goal is for workers to be able to make an informed choice about whichever job they choose as an independent contractor. Does this",labor
"Sort of get into a murky area of trying to define wages and tips for these workers, or else we should just classify them as employees if we're going to go with this route. I think It's a policy decision, rather than a determination on whether this information would make a worker, or whether providing tip information would make a comment on what on worker status. I think Inherently tips are discretionary by the customer so even if it is indicated in the beginning of an offer doesn't necessarily mean that the customer would actually end up paying that. That's one",labor
Way to look at it. So I Think that there is an argument that if a customer has indicated a tip that the worker should know that information because as an independent contractor they can choose or not choose what work they would like to accept. And that Right is memorialized in the flexibility section. On the,labor
"Other hand, if this amendment were to pass it would be discretionary so it wouldn't prevent the companies from providing that information, it would not require them to do so. One could Say that tips again aren't certain, so companies shouldn't be required to provide that information if there is a certain, if there is uncertainty about it, and companies might decide not to provide that information in order to promote more equal So I Think that it could go either way, but certainly see and understand your concern about workers not having the full amount of information that is available to companies when making that decision. Thank you",labor
"Wanted to make a clarifying comment about the base legislation and what it allows and requires which is that tip policies need to be disclosed to the workers up front and companies can allow for tips to be removed customers can remove tips and that has been an issue we've seen flagged. allows that To occur tips to be removed after an order is completed, even if they were given up front on the order, but it just needs to be disclosed within the policy that the company gives its workers. That's very Helpful information, Alex. Thank you,",labor
Can you remind me what New York did regarding this concept. Also my Understanding is that New York equivalent of the Office of Labor Standards is currently crafting their minimum payment policy right now so we don't know what it is. Correct me If I'm if I'm wrong on that Amy or Jasmine but I don't believe they've been given authority to develop a minimum payment policy but they're in the process of developing that policy. I do,labor
"Believe that I heard that there were some elements of that policy that went into place. About a Month ago and maybe a few weeks ago, but I'm not sure the status of the tip amount, or the tip disclosure. So we Can certainly look at that but I'm not aware if that is one of the pieces that went into effect already. You're looking",labor
Into that that is also my understanding is that a rule related to requirement to disclose pay up front. It has Recently passed in New York City. Did you Have a clarifying question. I don't,labor
"Staff presentation says on page for the policy goal of of establishing a minimum payment provide or ensure payment of minimum wage plus expenses with a per minute and per mile floor for the engaged time to perform each offer. And I Will simply say again that that is what we are doing. So, I Believe this does not conflict with the, with the overall rationale of this legislation before us. Thank you.",labor
"This area Of the policy I think fits more into the flexibility objectives of the, of the policy to make sure that the, the app based worker, as the information necessary to be able to choose whether or not to take a, a egg, and can't do that without having full information about the remuneration for the gig. I want To just flag that Councilmember Lewis and I received an email from a DoorDash worker before this amendment was, was developed and the DoorDash worker didn't know a lot. He's not",labor
"Involved with the Working Washington campaign, a DoorDash worker who sort of organically contacted us to say, oh yeah, there's a problem that I'm dealing with as a DoorDash worker and I sure hope your legislation deals with that. And this Constituent wrote, really concerned that DoorDash would continue to hide tips, noting that there's an incentive that DoorDash receives the same amount regardless of whether or not there's no tip or a very large one, and concerned that drivers without all the information are forced to accept and gamble whether or not the job will pay a fair wage. So again, More generally speaking, there are independent contractors and a part of work is being able to know upfront before accepting a job, what all the variables are, and that transparency, allowing workers to exert flexibility that is associated with this type of work. So, for",labor
"That reason, I appreciate the sponsor bringing the amendment forward but I will not be supporting this amendment. I totally See the point of the person who emailed you and in current situations, without knowing what the wage will be. So, but That's what I'm saying is that this legislation in itself does provide certainty that the driver will will earn a living wage. Council Member",labor
"Nelson, Council Member Esqueda. First, let Me highlight where I think there's maybe an area of common ground. One is I think that we want to make sure that all wages that are paid actually compensate workers to have a true minimum wage and work towards an actual living wage. I really",labor
"Applaud a lot of our restauranteurs and local breweries like Molly Moon's Ice Cream and Plum Bistro and Optimism Brewery, for example, that build in a higher minimum wage so that workers are never reliant on tips to actually know whether or not they're going to be able to put food on the table or pay their rent, for example. So, having Conversations separate about one true wage is something I'm really excited about if there's interest in that among council members and separate those specific to this legislation and this amendment in front of us. If there's Going to be the ability to add tips, I want workers to know what those tip amounts are. The amendment",labor
"Removes the tip amount from upfront disclosure requirement for each offer and just doing a quick analysis quick search here. I did Confirm with Council Member Herbold and our chair has said, which is that New York now requires tips to be disclosed in full to workers. So, companies Will already be required to do this in other jurisdictions. I think",labor
"Many of the concerns that we've heard from the companies is how do we apply different policies across different places across the country? Well, they're Already going to be doing it in New York now. I think Keeping the language in statute as the bill originally envisions is really important to make sure that we have full transparency for the workers doing this work. Tip stealing",labor
"Is still a very common practice, not just in this industry, but across the board. And I Want to make sure that tips are truly and transparently being displayed to the workers so that they know what is owed to them. There is Examples very recently in 2019 of Instacart paying back workers after tip stealing was exposed. DoorDash settled",labor
"Charges with the Attorney General of DC over a very similar issue. Amazon Flex Recently settled with the FTC over yet another tip stealing practice. So, given That these practices are prevalent across industries, again notably, but specific to this industry as I just explained through those three examples, there is good reason to have healthy skepticism about the handling of tips if they are not truly disclosed in advance so that workers know exactly what they should be receiving. I believe",labor
"This is an important component of the flexibility that Council Member Herbold noted, but also for the full transparency that we're shooting for in this legislation. So, I'll Be voting no on this. And again, If there's interest in one true wage conversation in the future, I'll be very excited about that discussion as well. Thank you,",labor
"Council Member Mosqueda. Amy, comments On that? I was Just going to reiterate, I think that Council Member Mosqueda mentioned that in April in New York City, it did go into effect that if known, the tip needs to be disclosed to the worker. In addition,",labor
"Their requirements are that prior to soliciting a gratuity from a consumer, the company has to disclose to the consumer the proportion or fixed amount of each gratuity that will be distributed to the delivery worker. And it Also requires that the companies disclose to delivery workers how much each consumer paid as a gratuity. So, it Definitely does address some of the questions that you guys are discussing. Thank you,",labor
"Ask central staff to circulate the New York program so that we can see, because I understood they're doing some other things that we might be interested in or not doing things that, you know, so it's helpful to have that comparison with New York. And just To clarify on this issue of the tips, if the customer tips the worker after the service is provided, that has to be disclosed to the worker, right? Correct, Council Member Peterson. That's part",labor
"Wanted to respond to Council Member Mosqueda's point that this does not facilitate, I believe, tip stealing. Workers will Know what they receive by tips just not provided up front, you know, for the single mom who's got a couple kids who just needs a box of wipes right now. And so, That is the essence of what I'm saying. I'm not",labor
"Putting this forward to create the conditions so that the worker does not know and therefore cannot track their tips. Thank you, Council Member Nelson, for that clarification. Appreciate that Response to Council Member Mosqueda. Any other",labor
"Stating facts for the industry in terms of the experience that workers have had with tip stealing. I'm not Saying that this amendment is in any way trying to promote tip stealing. I'm saying That it's important that we keep the underlying language so that workers know exactly what the tips are so that they know how much to receive and that they can measure their final paycheck with what they believe their tips should be with what they've received. So, that",labor
"Is the fact that this is what's already occurring in the industry and in other industries, and we need to work collectively to make sure that there's greater transparency for workers if tips are still going to be part of the known practice, especially in underpaid industries. So, look Forward again to having a conversation about One True Wage and for folks who aren't familiar with that campaign, looking forward to talking more about that. But this Is really a matter of transparency so that workers get the tips that have been committed. Thank you,",labor
"Would add a definition for cancellation without cause and clarify that a receipt is due to an app-based worker within 72 hours of a cancellation, whether it's with or without cause. The ordinance Currently requires a receipt to the app-based worker within 24 hours of the offer's performance or a cancellation with cause, does not specify a receipt requirement for a cancellation without cause. And right Now is not consistent with the chapter 837-080D, which allows or requires a company to have 72 hours for a company to review a cancellation. So this",labor
"Just kind of makes the timings all consistent where a receipt is due for any type of cancellation after 72 hours to make that consistent with 080D. Thank you so much, Jasmine. Very appreciated Your description. So again, This amendment in combination with the next amendment is designed to address concerns with potential fraud, adding a definition of cancellation without cause and clarifying that the receipt is due to an app-based worker within 72 hours of cancellation, whether or not it's with or without cause. There are",labor
"2 of this amendment was circulated to committee members this morning. And this Amendment would change the definition of engaged time to clarify that offers ending in a cancellation without cause by the app-based worker shall not incur any engaged time. My understanding Is that this is intended to address the concern brought forward where individuals could accept offers, cancel a lot of offers without cause, and still receive minimum payment. And this",labor
"Amendment would address that scenario where if an offer was canceled without cause, they would not receive minimum payment. This amendment Would also clarify that a network company can't take actions not prohibited by this chapter or other applicable law to remedy or prevent fraudulent use of the platform. And my Understanding is that this new section would not grant any additional substantive power to the companies. It's essentially",labor
"A clarifying sentence that they can take those actions if they deem as necessary as long as it's not prohibited by law. And this Amendment now, version 2, would require network companies to then create and share a policy with app-based workers regarding how fraudulent use would be identified and what actions may be taken to remedy or prevent fraudulent use, how workers will be notified that they were suspected of fraudulent use or flagged, and then a process for appeal. And finally, This amendment would then require that the Notice of Rights provide the worker with the location of this fraudulent use policy to bring attention to it. Thank you",labor
"Proposals were broad and would have allowed for companies not only to remove a worker for suspected fraud, but prevent them from accessing the apps and also take money back from a worker, even from a completed job if the company suspected fraud. This is A broad approach, but I appreciated the intent and the desire to address the issue. And I Want to note, of course, that fraud is a crime regardless of whether or not it's being committed by a worker or somebody who's defined as a W-2 employee. And if",labor
"You're a W-2 employee, employers can't take back wages that were paid. And as A crime, this issue is addressed in our court system. So we Just want to be really careful on how we work to address a perceived concern with future fraud and that we've landed on the language before us. And before",labor
Whether a cancellation is without cause under this scenario? So I Think the idea is that the companies would develop a fraudulent use policy and it would clarify the definition of engaged time. So that Offers that are ending in a cancellation without cause by the app-based worker shall not incur engaged time and therefore no pay. So this,labor
"Is intended for workers who complete the job. I'm not Sure if that answers your question. If not, Jasmine or Alex, you want to lend a hand? Go ahead,",labor
"Jasmine. Yes. Well, Essentially The companies will determine whether a cancellation was with or without cause and they have at least 72 hours to do so. The fraud",labor
"Policy requirement, I believe, does require that they have a process for appeal if a fraudulent use was determined, though. Thank you, Jasmine. And just To add to that, there is actually an exhaustive list of cancellation with cause in the legislation itself that workers could submit with the cancellation. And then",labor
"There are those that are without cause, but the cancellation with cause is an exhaustive list, though it's a little bit broad and its wording is outlined in the legislation. Thank you, Alex. Councilor Mosqueda. Thanks, Madam",labor
"Already have the ability to make policy on this, how does this fraud policy change what companies can already do? The policy Itself doesn't change what they can do, but it does require that companies provide notice of their policy to workers. And then The amendment as a whole does change the impact of cancellation without cause by allowing for engaged time not to be incurred. Thank you.",labor
"Little concerned about the consequence of having cancellation without cause being determined as fraud because I wonder whether or not businesses could start engaging in more penalizing strategies if we're incentivizing or codifying. The whole Determination of cancellation without cause seems to be exclusively in the hands of the company. They already Have this policy, so I'm just worried about whether or not this is sort of facilitating a new base or floor, Madam Chair. And so",labor
"12A, Version 1, is sponsored by Council Members Herbold and Mosqueda. This amendment Would change the effective date of the minimum payment requirements, that's Chapter 8.37, from 12 months to 18 months after Council Bill 120294 would take effect. So assuming",labor
"That the bill is passed by full council in June, that would be approximately a January 2024 effective date for those minimum pay requirements. Extending the Effective date of this chapter by six months would allow the city to consider the Office of Labor Standards funding needs over two budget cycles, the 2023 and 2024 budget deliberations, pursuant to the funding requirements of their enabling code provision 3.15.007. That is The provision in the SMC that requires that OLS's minimum annual contribution is funded by the business and occupation tax and any other funds in the general fund to make up the balance. And another",labor

Ensuring the Effective date of Chapter 837 comes six months after rules are filed with the City Clerk could provide network companies with more time to prepare for implementation. This amendment, If it was passed, I believe would supersede the previous amendment as it provides an additional requirement, but both amendments do contain the 18 months effective date. So both",labor
"This amendment were to pass, it potentially would override the just blanket 18 months effective date and would instead be the later, whatever comes later, either 18 months after the bill is signed by the Mayor or six months after rules are developed and filed with the City Clerk. But the Amendment we just voted on changes the effective date to 12 months after the passage. I'm sorry, 18 months. It changes",labor
"It from 12 to 18 months after the bill passes. Yes. The 12B Would have a different effective date. Yes, it",labor
"It will take some time between when the rules are known and then changing the code and all the other things that are necessary before, realistically, these rules can be incorporated into, not the business model, but the actual software of these companies. And so It was hard to decide how to express, okay, let's give them a buffer so that they're not immediately liable for violations as soon as the rules are known. And we Can't require that OLS say that make them, there's a difference between filing of the rules and the spirit of your amendment, the effective date. And so",labor
"What if the rules are filed at 18 months, then there is no time necessarily for, there is no time for these companies to modify their platforms. So that Is why, so I said 18 months anticipating that your amendment would pass and, but not knowing when there would be certainty about the rules. And so I just added six months on thinking that that would be a reasonable amount of time for the networks to make the changes to their code. Thank you,",labor
"Know, we don't have a history of when we pass labor standards, including the TNC fair share legislation of delaying implementation until after the director's rule process.

Again, I Would be, I would be concerned that we're somehow sending a signal that the legislation going into effect is contingent on a particular outcome around the development of the rules. And I",labor
"Council members to decide, you know, how much they want to entrust that, that, that to go forward or to order require the the rulemaking to happen in a certain time period or or require implementation to be after rulemaking, my understanding is not that that that could be something that that council can require of of OLS and that a contingent effective date is not unprecedented. It is Certainly for labor standards, but for for certain other regulations, there, there are contingent effective date so it would be a policy choice for the council on in this matter. Thank you. Any other",labor
"I meant 13 version one is sponsored by Councilmember mosquito. This amendment Would not endow the OLS director with new substantive authority. This amendment Would clarify councils intent, based on the introduced legislation that the Office of Labor Standards can assess investigation cost against the network company. This amendment",labor
"Would authorize the director to issue rules for assessing reasonable investigation cost and would strongly encourage the director to do so, to support implementation of this chapter 8.37 so I think my explanation just contradicted What I Want to say is that the director is already able to assess investigation costs against a network company in the existing language and the introduced legislation, which says that the director can assess the reasonable cost incurred in enforcing this chapter, what this amendment would seek to do is to clarify that those reasonable costs include investigation cost, and then the amendment would also encourage the director to assess those costs to support OLS is funding needs to implement this legislation. There are Other examples of other city departments that are able to assess and for enforcement costs, Seattle Department of Transportation can can assess enforcement costs for the enforcement of the street and sidewalk use code. Seattle Department",labor
"Does not seek to recoup investigation costs when enforcing any of our other labor regulations that work is performed by departmental staff whose salaries come out of the general fund in other words that is their job, and it's different from investigations in STC or s dot because those are a lot of them are paid for by permit applications so those are those can sort of be thought of as user fees in a way so I don't think that that's an accurate comparison of, of, of how we pay for investigations throughout the city of Seattle. This would Allow OLS to charge companies, even if there's no determination of violation it or if an investigation ends in a settlement, or because there's no language prohibiting it if an investigation is dismissed and according to OLS is interactive dashboard of the 989 investigations it's launched 66% have ended in settlement, and that's partly because businesses just want it to go away so they can get back to doing business 12% have ended in no determination of violation. Only 11% Have ended in a determination of violation, and 11% have been dismissed. So even",labor
"If one agrees or argues that it's the right thing to do to make companies who violate pay up regulations, pay for the cost of enforcement, in addition to attorneys if OLS uses outside counsel and addition, in addition to the fees for the actual violation. That's only A fraction of the labor expended in investigations for enforcing this whole package. So, allowing OLS to charge for the work to investigate all the other cases. to the",labor
"Companies that are really in violation. You know, Some could say that this creates this is a conflict of interest because it could create, you know, a. the willingness to investigate just for investigation sake I'm not saying that that is happening but but the bottom line is that this is, although OLS is allowed to do this, it is, it seems to. It would Be the first time this happens, and that is why I'm concerned about this amendment. Again, I",labor
"There is an interest on the part of businesses just settle. And I Don't think granting the OLS director the discretion to to consider this moving forward with the understanding that everyone has a shared interest in resolving these cases in a way that is expedient and that results in injustice for workers.

So don't throw us under the bus, and know that this is not just about us, but the animals are being affected by Rover's policy.",labor
"What are you going to reap from further delaying the payoff policy for Rover and past Rabbit? Oh, I know, more billions for the truly undeserving, unneeding, greedy folk opposed to the most immediate needs of drivers who need more the most every succeeding day as prices on everyday living essentials are climbing higher and higher 24-7. That's right.",labor
Good afternoon. My name is Leif. I am a former delivery driver for Uber Eats.,labor
"While scheduling freedom made the job strongly appealing for several years, I've decided that the drawbacks no longer make it worthwhile. The standard fare was already low when I began in 2017, and it has effectively been cut with inflation. Granted, Uber has recently been providing us with an extra $0.35 per trip to compensate for inflating fuel prices, but this gesture is not enough.",labor
"We need a real mileage cost accounted for, and the best way to do that is by basing mileage compensation on the IRS rate, not an arbitrary pay bump decided by Uber. Even with this bump, many jobs would leave me with only $3 or $4 after 30 to 45 minutes. Additionally, the exact tip amounts on Uber Eats are not visible until after the trip has completed, which means that I frequently have to guess if a trip is worthwhile, if a tip is worthwhile.",labor
"Requiring the tip to be visible on each trip would save drivers a lot of time with no negative consequences for Uber, and creating a pay standard would mean we no longer have to guess if we'll make enough to make a job worth it. The pay up policy has gone through years of refinement based on the inputs of the very people it is meant to aid, and it's time to make it into law. Our next speaker is David Ullman.",labor
"Now is the time for the City of Seattle to show essential workers and get companies that no one is above the law and that we deserve to be protected by this law. This law was designed to protect everyone, and it's not fair that our colleagues from TaskRabbit and Roger are left out from pay-off legislation. City Council members, we ask you to please protect all of us and to avoid loopholes so companies do not abuse their employees.",labor
We need a pay-off legislation to cover all essential workers. Thank you. Our next speaker is Kyle Mitchell.,labor
"My name is Kyle Mitchell. I'm a delivery partner for GoPuff, and I'm here to speak on behalf of passing the pay-off proposal. The gig workers of Seattle are heroes, period.",labor
"As a delivery partner, I can attest to the dangers that I take upon myself so that my customers, your citizens, do not have to. These include traffic dangers such as unsafe streets due to inclement weather, other drivers who exhibit extreme road rage, drivers who think that they own the road and ignore traffic laws, or drivers who are not skilled enough to handle driving these streets and make poor choices such as taking a left turn from the right-hand lane of a three-lane road. Then we get out of our vehicles to make our deliveries and are subject to the dangers of the people of this city.",labor
"Yes. Hi, this is Wei Lin. I've been working for GoPath as a gig driver since 2025.",labor
"When I started working on GoPath, I had no idea what I was facing. I had to put 70 and 80 hours to work on the week to try to get by, and each order only pays me $4. And sometimes that doesn't even cover our gas and miles cost.",labor
"If it was just me fighting for this, it wouldn't have been really difficult. But thousands of workers joined together and win this law, and with the payoff tax, we can finally have security and make sure we can survive in this city. So please, please listen to our voices and let this proposal pass, please.",labor
"Hello. Hello, my name is Davis Obenga, and I'm a gig worker, primarily with DoorDash, as well as a member of the Pay Up campaign. I want to first thank Council Member Harbold for advocating for gig workers.",labor
"We appreciate your efforts. Currently, gig workers in Seattle are not making a living wage relative to the cost of living. It's time for the City Council to rise up to the times and enact a pay floor for us gig workers.",labor
"We are in the beginning of a recession. The cost of living has gone up, and the pay is not increasing. We are still being paid less than minimum wage.",labor
"Today morning, I read a news report saying that DoorDash is removing the fuel subsidies that they enacted in order to help drivers pay for gas during the pandemic. I found out that they are removing that extra charge, but they're still charging customers money to pay for the fuel subsidy. This amounts to a pay cut in the middle of an economic recession.",labor
Yes. Yes. The payout policy has been written with the input of thousands of gig workers to be fair and equitable to all parties.,labor
The payout policy takes the first few steps to recognize and respect a gig worker's humanity by demanding workers be paid a living wage. Passing the payout policy will allow me to earn a wage in which I could thrive and flourish in society. I am one of the thousands of people with hidden disabilities that depend on gig work to make a living.,labor
I need and deserve to be paid on the living wage. App companies have made millions off my labor and have no intentions of investing in me or any of their workers. They are actively lobbying for the ability to force workers to work longer and more hours more frequently while keeping more and more of the profits for themselves.,labor
I am trusting the Council to pass the payout policy with no loopholes for me and all the gig workers in Washington because we are not disposable and should not be exploited. Thank you for your support. Our next speaker is Jake Lindsey.,labor
"This is Jake from District 6. I've driven for these companies, delivery companies, since they first arrived in Seattle in 2015 when our pay was higher and our cost of living was lower. I'm also a gig worker in other industries that are rapidly being gigafied by these companies into dystopian legal relationships where the workers aren't guaranteed a minimum wage, labor rights, benefits, or on-the-job protections.",labor
"I urge the Council to fill the loopholes backed by a mostly white wing of Council members who have shamefully amended this legislation to let many of these companies off the hook. These companies, like Rover, that do, in theory, allow us to set our own rates, in practice suppress platform search results of our services to customers if we don't follow the company's pricing guidance, which is to set our prices under minimum wage. So the Council's recent exclusion of thousands of sub-minimum wage workers amounts to stabbing us in the back when we're already being attacked by these companies from all sides.",labor
We have an opportunity here to set progressive local labor standards for gig workers other municipalities could replicate. Let's build on the momentum of workers bravely organizing to rebuild a fighting labor movement. Our next speaker is Brogan Thompson.,labor
"13 years ago, I had a stroke and I currently work for DoorDash right now. It's currently the only job I can do. I need you to focus on the Pay Up campaign to promote a more fair wage for everyone that's doing it.",labor
We strongly believe that the current method by which the pay standard is calculated will result in a cap on earnings for gig workers at minimum wage and nothing more. We propose an alternative method to calculate the standard that would allow the flexibility and earnings that drivers currently enjoy to continue. We really urge the council to slow down on this bill and not pass it yet and consider our proposal.,labor
"Additionally, we want to make sure that it is understood that we are ready to work on continuing to create a minimum earning standard for all gig workers, including those that have been excluded from this bill. But we do believe that needs to be a separate piece of legislation for the Marketplace Network companies. Thank you.",labor
"Members of our coalition have long advocated for minimum earning standards for their industry, like those in California, and a proposed ballot measure in Massachusetts that would provide the same benefits for workers. But this proposed legislation in Seattle payout, while well intentioned, is poorly drafted. The Seattle City Council proposes increased costs without regard for consumers or for the impacts on small businesses and ultimately drivers themselves.",labor
"If costs for delivery services are arbitrarily driven out of reach for consumers through mandatory regulation, then everyone will be hurt, including the drivers who will lose work as consumers choose other options or simply forego certain services. It is disappointing that the Seattle City Council has rushed to new regulations on delivery without studying what the economic impacts will be for small businesses and the drivers they claim to help. We surveyed these drivers just this month, and drivers who we can confirm are actually active on our platforms, and even though that these regulations...",labor
"Hi, my name is Ryan, and I am a full-time gig worker doing DoorDash and Uber and Instacart and a couple others in Seattle, and I'm firmly opposed to this thing. I make very good money. I can make anywhere from $26 to over $50 an hour sometimes doing this gig work, and if this goes through, I think it's going to be a disaster for everyone.",labor
"It's hyperinflationary. It's going to hurt restaurants. You know, imagine if you're a restaurant, and you're getting charged $4 more or $5 more for an order, and you have to pass it on to the customer.",labor
"What are your customers going to do? They're going to order food from out of Seattle, and that's going to hurt Seattle businesses. It's going to hurt votes for Seattle city council members.",labor
"It's bad for everyone, okay? And there's been a rumor going around that DoorDash are making plenty of money. DoorDash lost $161 million last quarter.",labor
"I'm calling in support of the payup proposal. Also, payup should cover all gig workers. All gig workers deserve the right to at least minimum wage.",labor
"I'm really disappointed that Council Members Peterson, Nelson, and Lewis passed, you know, headed with the gig companies of their workers and excluded a bunch of gig workers from payout. I guess it sort of proves the old adage, if you shoplift $7 of food from Target, you get arrested. But if you steal millions from your workers, then governments will listen to you in drafting legislation to avoid paying workers in the future.",labor
It's your job as government to make sure that people are paid what they deserve. And you should be more worried about making sure that workers are making a living wage than you are about companies' pensions rising too much. So let's get in touch with our priorities as a council and make sure to pass Peterson and get rid of the loopholes in pay up.,labor
"All right moving on we will go to the Public Safety and Human Services Committee uh Miss the Mighty Councilmember Herbold Madam Clerk can you please read item number two into the record will do the report of the Public Safety and Human Services agenda item two Council Bill 120294 relating to app-based worker labor standards establishing a compensation scheme for app-based workers with the minimum pay requirements and related standards for transparency and flexibility the committee recommends the bill pass Thank you Councilmember Herbold thank you so much uh Madam Chair and um have some initial remarks here and I think we also have um do we have an amendment we do all right so I will with your um with your permission uh kick us off with my initial remarks thank you um So as we all know we live in a very expensive city and we also know that many app-based delivery workers earn below the minimum wage after expenses and tips are accounted for one platform that claims its workers receive $28 an hour after including tips and not accounting for expenses also has one of the highest numbers of employees on food stamps in all of Washington State and one of the highest numbers of employees on Medicaid in all of Washington State we know that app-based work is one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy with more and more workers turning to this type of work and not receiving the protections of basic labor standards the passage of this legislation today would help tens of thousands of delivery workers make ends meet while maintaining their flexibility this conversation has been almost a year in the making on June 9th 2021 we held our first stakeholder meeting with since then a total of a dozen large stakeholder meetings followed by many additional one-on-one meetings I want to thank the many participants in those efforts this has included representatives from DoorDash, Uber Eats, TaskRabbit, Rover, Instacart, GoPuff, SHIP, Seattle Restaurants United, workers and worker advocacy groups such as Drive Forward, Working Washington, and the National Employment Law Project.",labor
During last week's committee discussion central staff walked us through 16 separate amendments the committee then voted and with one abstention and four votes in favor to recommend the bill to the full council today this is a testament to the hard work everyone has put into this process While we know there are still some app-based businesses that are concerned about the legislation the fact is that again this is a very expensive city to live and work in and if paying employees sub-minimum wage is the only way that businesses can sustain their model there should be some consideration whether or not that business model really works we know that these businesses are making record revenues with DoorDash reported nearly 5 billion in revenue in 2021 up 69 percent over 2020. They also paid their CEO over 400 million dollars in 2020.,labor
Uber Eats reported 5.8 billion dollars in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 beating their own estimates and Instacart's 2021 revenue grew 10 percent year over year to 1.65 billion. That company's valuation is 24 billion up for from almost 18 billion just a few months prior. Given this how is it that paying workers a minimum wage could be a threat to their business model?,labor
Though I'm really disappointed that the legislation is passed out of committee strip protections for many app-based workers let's remember that the the legislation that council passed last June the independent contractors protections ordinance means that independent contractors that are not covered by today's bill will have access to information so that they can receive pre-contract disclosures timely payment and payment disclose disclosures for services valued at six hundred dollars or more. The office of labor standards has been conducting their director's rule process this year for that bill and all of these protections will go into effect beginning September this year. To the small businesses concerned about price increases we know that a lot of small businesses are strongly in favor of of this legislation like Seattle Restaurants United but for those who do still have concerns do keep in mind that you are currently protected from price increases in April of 2020 the former mayor signed an emergency order that prevents app-based delivery companies from charging more than 15 percent of the purchase price of an order and I understand that council's working on drafting this policy as a council bill to extend that protection and I really look forward to supporting that really that incredibly important legislation.,labor
Remember every dollar in a low-wage worker's pocket adds one dollar and 21 cents to the economy and investment in our local businesses and it leads to job creation too. So as we heard today the app-based platform still have concerns I do want to highlight the other alterations made to the bill on their request that I did support. We reduced each of the associated cost factors the associated time factor and the associated mileage factor.,labor
These are all inputs that resulted in reducing the minimum payment calculation as originally proposed. We included a requirement that OLS office of labor standards produce the notices of rights and translations removing that burden from the company. We included a requirement that allows network companies to take adverse action against a worker for fraud if that company has a fraud policy and we had changed the effective date of the ordinance from 12 months to 18 months.,labor
Remember that the transportation network company legislation dubbed fair share was passed unanimously back in November 2019. The effective date for that legislation was January 1st 2021. That gave them 13 months for rulemaking and for companies to adjust.,labor
For pay up we now have an effective date of 18 months after passage that's five months longer than fair share. This gives the platforms more time to adjust but also remember it also means that the workers that we've been hearing from today will be waiting two years longer for the same kind of guarantees that TNC drivers are already receiving thanks to our legislation. I have some closing remarks after hearing and some a lot of thanks give hopefully after hearing the amendment but that's what I wanted to say for my opening remarks.,labor
Thank you well I did watch the committee over the weekend and it was disappointing to see workers on marketplace network companies get excluded from the policy at the last minute. I do believe that we need to make sure that these workers are protected as well. This amendment really expresses council intent to consider regulating marketplace network companies regarding minimum payment flexibility and transparency protections in separate legislation no later than next summer August 1st 2023.,labor
I think it's important that we pass the pay up legislation today and continue moving forward on additional policies to protect workers in our city because whether you get a job from an app or a want ad work is work and every worker deserves basic rights like minimum wage. So I am offering this amendment today in hopes that my colleagues will support it. Thank you Council Member Morales.,labor
This is the first in a series of measures to right-size long-standing inequities in our local economy that the introduction of gig work and app-based work has driven over the past decade of technological changes and shifts in our economy. You know this legislation by no means is going to be the final word on this. I appreciate the amendment brought by Council Member Morales putting a timeline for one aspect of future legislation which will be looking at ways to create some level of certainty and regulation into how the marketplace apps conduct their work but also several other pieces of legislation including how deactivations work in this world and transparency and notice of how these pay standards impact folks who are in this gig economy.,labor
As Council Member Morales just noted a lot of this work increasingly is being driven not because it's new work or new types of jobs that people do but because there are new ways to deliver them across varying business models. This Council previously moved to regulate the transportation network companies Uber and Lyft in that same vein. Today we extend those regulations to delivery companies and soon we'll be considering other aspects in this economy and appreciate the work of Council Member Herbold in bringing this together.,labor
I voted yes on the amendment and of course I support the legislation as a whole and I thank all the workers who spoke today and previously in public comment in support of legislation. As a socialist I have repeatedly explained in the past that big business under capitalism has enormous power and every victory of the workers movement that has been won comes under attack and is gradually chipped away when the movement ebbs. The only alternative really is to fundamentally end the power that big business has to claw back every penny that workers have won and fight for global socialism.,labor
Big business does not want to pay minimum wage does not want to respect other worker rights and when we say big business it's not an you know inanimate object it is the billionaires it's the multi-millionaires it's the very wealthy the elite. So they invent the notion of gig workers so-called gig workers independent contractors and suddenly you have a whole section of the workforce where workers rights regulations apparently do not apply. The evolution of the gig industry is also linked in other ways to the fundamental nature of capitalism.,labor
"It is not only the reforms that have been won by workers are constantly under attack which they are but the gig industry also illustrates how as the global capitalist system has gone deeper and deeper into a long-term crisis over the last decade the billionaires and the multi-millionaires have increasingly created more and more avenues to squeeze every last drop of blood from the global working class and that is why you see the evolution of such industries. Now that the pay up legislation would extend minimum wage protections to gig workers at the last minute and committee council members Peterson, Nelson and Lewis passed an amendment to create a new legal section called so you know quote unquote marketplace network workers and no doubt more and more big businesses will redefine sorry marketplace network workers no doubt more and more big businesses will redefine themselves into that loophole. Really the city council should be reversing that loophole but that was not the amendment before us in the last vote.",labor
I support this legislation to close the loophole in minimum wage protections created by the independent contractors legal notion and I will support closing the marketplace network loophole too if council members want to do that. The workers movement fights for better wages and that is essential and we also need to fight for socialism so we are not continually the working class is not continually forced to fight for the right to survive. Thank you.,labor
"The co-sponsors of this legislation it's my great privilege and pride to be able to support you in this legislation today and to continue to underscore for members of the public how long this process has been underway and to say that it's been coming for a long time is an understatement. We knew that this type of legislation was needed for basic standards to protect gig workers and the concept of the pay up legislation and the campaign from community really got a lot of attention way back in 2019 and since then gig workers, frontline workers, essential workers and workers that we deem to be heroes have only since then because of the pandemic been put more in the spotlight in terms of the type of work they've done and more at risk to do the work that they do during this pandemic. So I'm excited to support this legislation today and to recognize the many months the years of hard work that went into this piece of legislation and to really as well thank the staff from the co-sponsors Alex Clardy and Camila Brown.",labor
"Okay council member Morales. Thank you I am also excited for this legislation and the pieces that I know will be coming in subsequent weeks and months we know that there's over 40,000 workers in Seattle who depend on good work particularly people with disabilities, people of color, immigrants, single parents, LGBTQ workers and these apps while they do provide an opportunity for folks to find employment who might have challenges otherwise they also shift all of the cost and all of the risk to workers and really leave them earning well below minimum wage after expenses. We know that a recent report found Seattle gig workers are getting paid just $9.58 an hour, 92% of jobs pay less than minimum wage and we know that there has been an exploitation of a glaring loophole in our labor standards simply calling workers independent contractors these multi-billion dollar gig apps have been able to evade basic worker protections and that's the problem that we're trying to solve here so the pay up policy that is up for vote today will close that loophole it will ensure basic protection for thousands of workers by ensuring that they are paid at least minimum wage with other basic protections regardless of whether somebody's cleaning a house or you know delivering food that's the goal is to make sure that that regardless of the kind of app that they're on we are protecting workers and those who companies choose to call contract workers so I think it's an exciting day Seattle is leading the way by listening to gig workers providing them what they need and these jobs as I said have the potential to be good paying jobs with important options for people who need flexibility I do think it's important that rather than pass fair pay costs onto consumers companies some of which saw their revenue soar by close to 70% as Council Member Herbold said should themselves pay the true cost of labor out of their own pockets and stop the exploitive model of from becoming the new norm I'm looking forward to supporting this to supporting future legislation and continuing this conversation over the next year I do want to thank my staff as well Alexis Oliver and Debra and Silvernail who've been working on this with our colleagues and look forward to supporting thank you Council Member Morales I really like what you had to say Council Member Nelson thank you very much I support a minimum pay standard for delivery drivers but I've always been concerned that setting the per delivery fee too high will lower demand which could result in the unintended consequences of reducing drivers overall income as well as the revenue of small businesses like restaurants it could also disproportionately impact the most vulnerable customers who also tend to be low income and might not be able to afford the fee so I'm ambivalent about this legislation but I'll be supporting it today because it's vastly improved from the bill that was introduced most significantly by Council Member Peterson's amendment which I supported to remove marketplace companies from being covered by Working Washington's proposal because I believe their inclusion was an overreach it made no sense to me to regulate apps used by service providers who set their own rates and negotiate directly with the customers to provide things like home health care child care pet care and help with household tasks just because those professionals use an app to reach some of their customers and plus I just really hadn't seen convincing evidence that the majority of them make under the minimum wage so I ran as a pragmatist and quite frankly this this proposal has a long history and I believed it would pass so I submitted several amendments and collaborated with my colleagues to minimize its negative impacts voting no would diminish their confidence that I can negotiate in good faith to improve future legislation whatever it is and so well that's what pragmatism is and I'll be voting yes today great thank you Council Member Nelson and I like what you said too so I'm going to be supporting this and I'll tell you why I probably should tell everyone I like what they said but I'll say I'll share with you why I'll be voting yes but Council Member Morales and Council Member Nelson kind of hit the nail on the head for me we have been dealing with the gig economy and I like what Council Morales said and I've always felt this way it to some degree it is a very exploitive model and until we answer the question about whether or not a gig worker is an employee or indeed a contract worker and we haven't addressed that straight on for the labor and for this economy and the people that actually take on these jobs we're going to continually piecemealing being trying to how to decide this works when we have a gig economy I believe we're going in the right direction that this is the shape of things to come because this is it's a labor issue and there's a surge about people who these are their jobs and I think it is unconscionable that the and I'll just say that the bigger business companies have made billions of dollars during this during our pandemic and if that's what it took and as you know the pandemic has taught us many lessons if that's what it took for us to get here for people to recognize how much money these companies are making on people who they cannot do not have to call them employees so what we have done as a city and a lot of other cities as well is taking it upon ourselves as we should do as elected officials to start deconstructing this economy and making sure that the people who are on the front lines who were delivering food who are doing all those things are compensated and are taken care of",labor
"Because that's our job at the end of the day as government officials is to make people's lives hopefully better so with that councilmember herbal I'll hand it over to you to closing remarks and then we'll call on the clerk to call the roll thank you so much I really appreciate my colleagues excitement for the vote that we're about to take in closing I just want to read a couple sentences from the May 10th letter to council from the National Employment Law Project they start talking about the history of the minimum wage I quote the new deal legislation excluded domestic agricultural and tip workers from their wage protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act it systemically denied black people and workers of color the ability to earn the wages guaranteed to workers in industries dominated by white workers and the legacy of this injustice continues today more recently venture capitalists running app-based businesses deny workers the minimum pay and benefits that should be universal as the city council itself recognized black and latinx workers comprise a disproportionate share of the 40,000 individuals performing app-based work in Seattle the fact that app-based workers are disproportionately immigrants and people of color reflects on the racialized exploitation within the app-based delivery and marketplace industry indeed the app-based gig economy writ large functions on occupational segregation companies can get away with offering poor quality unsafe jobs where workers have virtually zero legal protections on the job because for so many workers there is simply no alternative far from offering economic opportunity this business model deepens the desperation of underpaid black latinx and other workers of color who have been shunted to the bottom of the economy in closing in addition to the stakeholdering process i talked about earlier the pay policy package has been discussed six times in a council committee my council committee since july of 2021 i am just so honored to have had the opportunity to work with this growing workers movement who are determined to not be left behind there's significant support for this legislation including from from the

nor islamic community center el centro de la raza casa latina asian counseling and referral service the national domestic workers alliance the national employment law project seiu 775 seiu 6 the transit writers union and the labor standards advisory commission We will continue our work with additional legislation to cover issues such as restaurant access anti-discrimination background checks deactivation and the creation of an advisory board and i will continue to work with all stakeholders on the development of these policies i want to thank council members and their staff specifically

"Did we meet the minimum standard of 40%? The answer was yes. Across the system, no.",labor
"We have no fines, so there's no stress. If the book's not on hold for somebody, it automatically renews so that you're not worried about it. Next, please.",labor
And so we've added a new premium to kind of help that process. The captain's flex time buyout to describe what flex time is just because it's not really self-explanatory. Flex time is what captains can accrue instead of overtime.,labor
"So if a captain does overtime, Instead of getting compensated for that overtime financially, they're able to accrue what was referred to flex time. It can be used kind of like vacation time, except it can't be cashed out normally. So what we've had as a system where officers.",labor
"Based on prior agreement, we're able to accrue up to 384 hours. If they wanted. Had a reason to get more than 384 hours.",labor
They had to get special approval to go over that cap. And so what we've done here is we're reducing the cap down to 200 hours. And so that will make it so that there's kind of less hours floating out there over time.,labor
"So it will be a resource saver for the city in the longterm, even though we are cashing out the hours. Upfront. So at the beginning of the process, the captains can, for hours in excess of 200, they can cash it out at 35%.",labor
"And at the end of the process, they can cash them out at 25%. So it's not an hour for our cash out. It's a reduced percentage cash out.",labor
"Or during the period where we're transitioning to 200 hours, they're able to use. Those flex time hours instead of cashing them out. The sick leave currently has a cash out system of a flat 25%.",labor
We're moving to a tiered system that also allows Viva. And so there'll be a vote by the union for Viva. And so the tiered system has a cash out system.,labor
It's called Viva. Viva is a voluntary employee benefits account. And so it's can be used for healthcare costs.,labor
"If the tiered system has cash outs for 25%, 50% and then 75%. Based on how many hours there are. And both the flex time changes and the sick leave changes.",labor
"Dash is a program that empowers community organizations like United way to increase food access to their communities. And at the state level, Washington residents, we all know that food insecurity is an ongoing issue and especially during the pandemic. And so what this program does is it, it links United way and other end food providers with door dash and they deliver food to people who otherwise would not have access to it.",labor
"I cannot find one honest man. What is your point for commission? So it looked to me very strange because when this one crook or two crooks, yeah, it's happened, bad apple.",labor
"There wouldn't be that can someone actually, for the record, affirmatively answer that. Yes, we are not seeking any additional hours over what we have been previously using for the previous 10 years of the agreement. Thanks.",labor
"And so no match is required and you lower the minimum threshold from $1.2 to just no minimum threshold? Up to $750,000. Okay, thank you very much.",labor
"Thank you, Council Member. In this slide, we really show that the design was modified to accommodate this really significant and beautiful tree. So SDOT likes trees, the city likes trees, the community likes trees.",parks
"All right. Hi, my name is Ryan. I'm a homeowner in Seattle and I want to talk about the tree policy and the housing growth targets.",parks
"We could add 40,000 new trees. I think everybody would support this. But secondly, I want to comment on the targets and resolution 32048.",parks
"75% of where we're experiencing deforestation in our urban tree canopy is our neighborhood residential zone. Council bill 120207 to create a tree service provider registration is one small step to address the problem. Although not under consideration today, we also want to move the oversight of trees out from SDPI and make it its own budget item that can be tracked year to year, maybe under office of sustainability and environment or department of neighborhoods who oversee historic preservation.",parks
"Saving our trees is way more important than saving the show box. As a renter in the US district, I spent thousands of dollars taking care of a tree because my out of state landlord wouldn't. We can't expect that of renters, especially when we don't have rent stabilization or rent control and can't plan to see the benefits of our investments in our trees.",parks
"We need a city managed plan, 30% tree cover by 2030. Thank you, Laura. Up next, we have Ryan Donahue, followed by Judy A. and then Rachel Ludwig.",parks
"My name is Judy Acolytis, speaking for Agenda Item 2. Recently, three healthy eight-year-old trees were removed from a newly purchased property in three hours. The tree company said a permit was not needed.",parks
"However, another potential buyer of the property had measured those same trees, and one of the trees was definitely too large in circumference to be removed without a permit. It was an illegal cut. With this bill, that tree might still be here sucking carbon out of our air and helping to prevent 106-degree summer days.",parks
"I ask you to please allow for 14 days for posting a tree removal notice on private property, the same time as stop planting strips. Please vote yes for CB12027 and adopt amendments from council members Peterson and Strauss. Thank you very much.",parks
"I live in Beacon Hill, actually, and I'm also commenting on Agenda 2. So, my main concern with regulations as proposed is that I live in an already multifamily area, and the way development goes on in our neighborhood currently makes it very hard for us to keep trees on lots and still provide homes, and it's very important for climate change reasons that we encourage people to live in a dense area. And so, my concern is that these regulations aren't doing enough or really anything to encourage that development to take place and keep existing trees because we are actually going to have more heat events, and those trees are most critical, not for sucking carbon out of the air, but for making our cities livable as climate change is happening, as we try to work to reduce the impacts of climate change.",parks
"We need people to live in our cities to reduce those impacts. So, I'm very concerned we're not doing enough. We also, as someone previously said, we aren't doing enough to ensure that we build trees equitably because, depending on the redevelopment, to get more tree canopy isn't enough because you have to depend on trees being, you know, redeveloped, which only happens in wealthier areas.",parks
"We've been really loving all the large trees in the neighborhood. One in particular was a gorgeous large coast redwood on the side of our neighbor's yard, which provided shade, habitat for birds, and just really a gorgeous relaxing view at our backyard and bedroom windows. Unfortunately, just yesterday, the tree was removed by a well-known tree removal company who's known for removing trees illegally.",parks
"They did not have a permit, and we really don't see any reason to remove this gorgeous beauty. We are working with landscape architects for our own yard who said it was nearly certain it was close to being an exceptional tree that should have definitely had a permit to be removed, if it even should have been removed at all. It would be really great to include the additional amendment to Bill 120207, which would prohibit any tree service provider from working in Seattle for a full year if they have two or more violations.",parks
"Thank you so much. I want to thank all responsible for the tree service provider registration legislation item two, particularly Councilmembers Peterson and Strauss for your amendments. I strongly support substitute bill one with those amendments included.",parks
"Obviously, we need comprehensive tree protection legislation, but for environmental reviews. I particularly appreciate the delineation of specifics regarding hazardous tree removal. Thank you for that.",parks
"And we need one agency in charge of tree protection in this city. Thank you. Thank you, June.",parks
"A little bit. Hello, Councilmembers. My name is Richard Ellison, and I live in the Wedgewood community, a neighborhood that prides on its big trees.",parks
"Please vote yes for substitute bill SB-120-207 and all amendments from Chairperson Spouse and Councilmember Peterson. Seattle's been waiting decades to improve its private property tree protection, and arborist restoration is... Registration, excuse me, is already required by SDOT for tree work for many years now.",parks
"Over a weekend a few years ago, I saw some big trees being cut at the Wedgewood pool, and neighbor filed a complaint. By the time the inspector came out the next week, the stump had been completely ground down and no violation was identified. The tree company, a major company, might not have cut the trees if it required threatening their license to cut an exceptional tree.",parks
"Substitute bill 120-207 also supports improved requirements on how exceptional trees are identified as hazardous to prevent misuse of the category. Because subdivision developments are causing tremendous tree losses, it's particularly important to Amendment 3, codifying guidance to subdivision developments to maximize conservation. Thank you, Richard, and please do feel free to email in any further comments.",parks
"I'm chair of TREE PAC, and we support the legislation here to require registration of tree service providers. We note that this is something that SDOT already has been doing for nine years, and eight states nationally already require this type of tree service. In in their states require a tree service registration.",parks
"It includes California, Connecticut, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. I do have concern about putting tree service providers on retainer rather than being employee because this is not what most of these other states do. And also strongly support the public notice noting that we personally about 10 years ago had a pickup truck in our driveway ready to cut down a tree when we came home and asked what they were doing, and they said, bring it down.",parks
"So who said that? It was a neighbor, and it was our tree. That's why public notice.",parks
"I'm calling in today to ask you to vote no on amendment number three for the tree service providers bill. There are several serious problems with this proposed amendment. First of all, tree care professionals are not experts on land use or platting matters and are wholly unqualified to opine on the relationships of lot lines and other platting issues to treat.",parks
"Secondly, the underlying platting criteria cited in this amendment is unclear and very subjective. Various SDCI staff give various meanings to the provision, and the hearing examiner has also had issues about the meaning of this provision. Furthermore, it puts the emphasis on the tree retention rather than promoting rational platting of properties to support the regional development of housing.",parks
"My name is Jane Foy. I'm calling in support of CB120207. I think it is very important to have reputable tree service providers register with Seattle Department of Construction and Inspection, just like Seattle Department of Transportation.",parks
"This is an overdue, needed action that you can take today. We have lost numerous trees in my neighborhood due to illegal cutting just within this past year. I support CB120207 in all the amendments except allowing tree providers one violation a year.",parks
"To me, this just doesn't make any sense at all. Also, I feel that tree protection should be handled by the Office of Sustainability and Environment and not by Seattle Department of Construction and Inspection. Thank you.",parks
"Plant Amnesty's board and membership, many of whom are professional arborists, urge councilmembers to vote yes today for CB120207 and all published amendments from Councilmember Peterson and Chair Strauss. We've waited years for better policies to conserve Seattle's mature trees and urban forest canopy, so please don't delay adoption of this bill. We have sent a letter to councilmembers in advance of this meeting supporting the existing amendments and outlining some additional policies we would like to see addressed by this bill and subsequent legislation.",parks
"They include extending the posting notice to two weeks to match SDOT's posting schedule, since any questions or concerns typically take more than three days to resolve. Requiring all tree service provider trucks to have their company name clearly displayed on their vehicles, as well as the registration sticker with city phone number or website to allow citizens to verify registration. And in addition, along with our mission to teach best practices to homeowners and organizations through our slate of classes, we strongly support the creation of a program.",parks
"All the old trees in Seattle are falling to the ground, from the city limits all the way to Puget Sound. The people who are cutting them come from everywhere. They may not have a permit or be registered, but they don't care.",parks
"They are the murderers, the tree murderers. They keep cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting them down. Please do what you can to save what is left of our mature and exceptional trees.",parks
We need these people to be registered who are cutting our trees. I have to pay for a license in Seattle. I'm a music teacher.,parks
"Electricians, plumbers, they need to pay. These people need to be registered. Save our trees to save yourselves.",parks
"Our next item is Council Bill 120207, which requires tree service providers to register with the city. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the abbreviated title into the record? Agenda item two, Council Bill 120207, an ordinance relating to land use in urban forestry, adding a tree service provider registration procedure and requirement.",parks
"Thank you for scheduling Council Bill 120207 for a vote out of committee today and for your hard work on it, Chair Strauss. Colleagues, as you may recall, this bill to register tree service providers who want to exceed routine pruning or cut down trees was introduced last October, and we walked through the specifics at our committee on February 9th. The amendments published with today's agenda reflect much of the discussion we had last month, and I urge you to support all of these amendments.",parks
"I know we'll discuss them individually here. Passing out of committee today, this Council Bill 120207 will be a small but mighty step to increase transparency and accountability by simply having tree service providers register with our city government before they cut down more trees. In the midst of the climate crisis inflicting severe heat waves, let's not have any more trees sawed to death in the middle of the night by chain saws wielded by unknown tree cutters.",parks
"Let's daylight these operations on a registry for all to see. Professional arborists who care about trees and follow the rules already register with the city for removing trees on public land, and this bill will create that transparent and accountable process for all other properties in our emerald city and our evergreen state. Due to the horrible heat waves last year, we saw once again the negative disparate impacts to communities that have seen a loss of tree canopy and experienced harmful heat island effects.",parks
"Increasing accountability and transparency by registering tree service providers who cut down or heavily prune trees should improve compliance with current and future protections of Seattle's trees and help those neighborhoods most at risk of losing more trees. I want to thank the dozens of tree advocates who already know very well the environmental and health benefits of existing mature trees, and it was steadfastly urged the Council to do more about the city's twin-linked tree canopy. Similar to what we saw in February, we saw during the past 24 hours dozens of emails asking us to pass this council bill today.",parks
"I want to thank those who took time to call in today. Also the Seattle Audubon Society, we did just get an email from them. TreePak, Friends of Seattle's Urban Forest, heard from many of these same supporters for the past two years.",parks
"I think we had a good introduction by Council Member Peterson. So my intention with this presentation is to describe Council Bill 120207 that would establish a requirement that tree service providers register with the City prior to conducting commercial tree work privately. As a reminder, the City already has a tree service provider registry that is administered by the Seattle Department of Transportation, also known as SDOT.",parks
"It is only for entities doing work on trees in the public right-of-way. We did discuss the potential impacts of the bill at the meeting on February 9th, so we will instead today focus on some of the key points from the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections Implementation Analysis, which is attached to the agenda today, and then also discuss the potential amendments that are attached to the agenda. So as a reminder, this legislation would amend Seattle Municipal Code Title 25 to require that Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, also known as SDCI, establish a registry process and system within 90 days of the effective date of the ordinance.",parks
"Tree service providers would then have 90 days to register with SDCI following the setup period. After this 90 days, all tree service providers would need to be registered in order to apply for prints or provide tree-related reports to SDCI. It would define commercial tree work as conducting major pruning, removal of trees larger than six inches diameter at breast height, and the assessment of tree health or hazard risk for financial compensation.",parks
"It excludes routine pruning activities that do not meet the threshold of major pruning. It would define tree service provider as an entity engaged in commercial tree work and require that registered tree service providers comply with various best practices related to the specific type of work for which they are engaged, such as maintaining adequate supervision over their workers as they conduct the work, assessing what the appropriate level of tree work is needed to meet the client's objectives. To authorize SDCI to create rules as needed to support administration of the registry, amend other sections of Title 23 to align with the legislation's intent, only registered tree service providers conduct commercial tree work.",parks
"SDOT allows tree service providers to either have a currently credentialed international society of arboriculture certified arborist on staff or retainer, whereas the Council Bill 120207 would require that that person be on staff. There is also a shorter public notice requirement, and a number of folks in public comment noticed this, noted this. I would just note for you all that the difference acknowledges that the SDCI public notice is more about just letting people know that commercial tree work is authorized, but is not necessarily an appealable decision, right?",parks
"So that is just something that SDCI acknowledges, and whereas SDOT's public notice is actually intended to inform and allow people to appeal the decision, and thus there's kind of that greater span of time because these are publicly owned trees, right? So there's a kind of a difference of who owns the tree and who's making that decision. And also the penalty would be different if the bill, as introduced, SDOT would remove.",parks
"So SDOT's current practice is to remove a tree service provider from the registry for a year after it's been issued two notices of violation. The proposed registry would prohibit SDCI from accepting tree-related reports from a tree service provider who has been issued a single notice of violation related to the illegal removal of an exceptional tree. So I kind of ran through that, but does anyone have any questions about anything on this slide before I move on?",parks
"The first of three amendments today is a substitute amendment that council member Peterson and I co-sponsored together. This substitute reflects a suite of changes we agreed to and include that will make this legislation more effective. It includes technical changes, extends the implementation time to five months in line with SDCI's implementation memo and sets a date certain November 10th for tree service providers to register by.",parks
"It allows for tree service providers to have an arborist either on staff or on retainer rather than only on staff and aligns penalties with SDOT's registry so that a tree service provider would be removed from the registry for one year after two violations. And lastly, it adjusts the requirements for tree risk assessment qualification or track requiring that an applicant for hazardous tree removal permit must be track qualified and requiring that for hazardous exceptional trees, a different tree service provider must file the permit rather than as compared to the provider who plans to do the removal. You'll want to, council member Peterson, did I miss anything?",parks
"Chair, you did. I think you got all the critical points on what is included. Some of those things are not reflected in this table, in particular, the hazardous tree permit requirements that you note.",parks
"But I am noting in this slide where now there is kind of more consistency between SDOT's registry and what would be in the council bill before you, amended council bill before you. So again, noting the ISA certified arborist on staff or retainer, so now that one will match. Public notice would be- sorry, there's another amendment.",parks
"And so SDCI anticipates that it will take about five to seven months to build the registry and associated automated features that would help with registration and creating public notices. And also that SDCI noted that this new system needs to integrate with the overall Acela permitting system so that reviewers are able to easily confirm that tree service providers are registered as required. The department estimates that the total cost of implementing this proposal this year will be between about $300,000 and $470,000 with roughly half of this amount supported by the general fund and the remainder can be permit fee supported.",parks
And the city already requires that anybody removing a tree have the ISA track or tree risk assessment qualification credential so that is already a requirement. But the change here is more around codifying some of the requirements that are in what SDCI has a hazard tree tip that they updated a couple of years ago that includes a report about the health of the tree. But the difference here is that we would have a tree if the tree that would be removed that is also being deemed hazardous would meet the city's definition of exceptional.,parks
This would require that there be two different registered tree service providers involved. So there would be one who would independently assess the tree and submit the required application materials and then the other tree service provider would perform the major printing or removal. So in no case can there be just one tree service provider who applies for the permit and performs the removal.,parks
So that is a new requirement that the city does not have. But otherwise the required report the ISA track credential those are existing requirements. Thank you Yolanda.,parks
This would require that either a registered tree service provider or state registered landscape architect provide a report describing how the design of a proposed subdivision supports the city's policy of maximizing retention of its existing trees. Currently the city only requires that a registered surveyor draw plat maps and does not require an explanation of how the plats were drawn to maximize retention of its existing trees. We just note that the subdivision process does not necessarily does not involve permitting development directly but does usually take proposed development into account such as building footprints and vehicular access.,parks
It's the same language that was actually in the February 3rd central staff memo on the February 9th agenda. And basically it says either a registered tree service provider or Washington state licensed landscape architect will prepare a report. It could be less than a page.,parks
Submit it to the director of STCI and that's only if there's going to be a subdivision or boundary line adjustment. And they would simply describe how they're trying to maximize retention of trees. It's not required that the trees be retained.,parks
"It's really just if we're trying to get at this goal of yes yes and yes we can maximize units, we can maximize trees. It's really about just being more creative and proactive early in the process. Configuring the footprint of the proposed building in a way that tries to retain the trees.",parks
So it's having trees top of mind earlier in the process. I know that creative architects and landscape architects can can get this done to maximize both units and trees. And this is just requiring that they put down on paper how they're trying to do that.,parks
"And I unfortunately will not be able to support the amendment today. While I appreciate your intent to ensure we are maximizing the protection of trees during subdivision process, I do believe that this change will impose added costs on housing without addition a new public benefit. As we already have a requirement as part of the subdivision process that applicants must maximize the retention of existing trees.",parks
And when SDCI reviews applications for subdivisions one of their responsibilities is to ensure that existing trees are being retained to the maximum extent possible. We've had so many conversations in this committee about the permitting process backlog and delays associated with our permitting process. I can't I have to remain committed to those goals of moving this work forward.,parks
Oh still on mute. Sorry about that. I think so I did have a brief conversation with Council Member Peterson about this and I I'm not sure if if he or Yolanda would want to answer these questions but I do have kind of some I think some sequencing questions about what would happen if the intent here is to maximize retention of trees.,parks
Is the requirement to submit the report to delay or you know to prevent the tree from getting cut down or is it just to provide information? So it doesn't sound to me like it's required to get approval to cut the tree down and so that makes me just wonder what the what the point is. So maybe Yolanda you can kind of walk me through like the sequence of what information we would gather from this and and what purpose it would serve.,parks
Sure so I mean I think this as I had mentioned before the the subdivision process does not necessarily it's not permitting actual development right so wouldn't permit removal of trees. It is just kind of that process is for a developer to show how the lots will be drawn right those that's the plat map and then as an a part of the approval of that plat map this report would be required right so prior to SDCI saying okay good your subdivision looks good we we still would this would be a new report added to that process. Now in terms of what the report is exactly that would be that is up to SDCI.,parks
You know in my former life as a landscape architect I you know could imagine writing you know a brief paragraph saying that this is drawn in such a way that you know this this this north lot was kind of configured so that this specific tree was maybe kind of in the corner versus in the center of the lot right so something like that so I you know it's it is I think intentionally vague to give SDCI some space to decide what it is that they are they would think is helpful in terms of decision making and reviewing the plat map that is proposed. Is that helpful? Yeah I think I appreciate it.,parks
Is that the case? There is an existing policy at states as part of the approval process that the SDCI director shall consider how the proposal maximizes the retention of the existing tree so that you are correct that is an existing policy. Okay I to the good sponsor and for the Chair and the committee I think this is an interesting concept.,parks
I am supportive of the intent to make sure that those retention policies are robust. I'm hoping that this actually might be something that we could continue to flesh out a little bit more given the ongoing tree protection ordinances that we will be considering later this year and I'd be really interested in hearing from the department directly about what to what extent SDCI is seeing maybe a problem with the current approach whether we can look for ways to strengthen that enforcement in the upcoming tree protection ordinance and especially how we can strengthen that without adding additional time or processes to the already existing permitting process which we know just equals additional costs and if we're thinking about building things like housing additional time and cost to that. So I do appreciate the intent here.,parks
I think one of the concerns from some in the community is that SDCI has put in a difficult position. They're required to do so many different things with the project and there is a whole movement out there to have trees under office of sustainability environment or some single department and I think this was just a small step to say let's be more mindful and creative earlier in the process so that we can do both maximize units and trees. That won't happen on its own and so this was a way of doing it where you have the expertise of the landscape architect or arborist to opine briefly about how they are maximizing and that could in fact help the SDCI director make a better decision if they are informed by that expertise early on by the landscape architect or the arborist when there is a lot line adjustment which is all this is proposing to do.,parks
The change from just three days before tree removal to three business days to avoid a scenario in which a notice is posted on a Friday for a Monday removal. It also requires that the notice include additional information such as the copy of the tree service provider's registration and whether a permit is required for removal or not. It also clarifies that the hiring entity as in the property owner or manager is responsible for posting the notice.,parks
Yolanda did I miss anything with that? One minor thing is that the tree service provider would provide said notice to the hiring entity. So that is one small thing but otherwise you got it all.,parks
I did want to take a quick second just to thank you Mr. Chair and also council member Peterson. Council member Peterson thanks for your leadership between the two of you for bringing this bill forward and I especially want to thank you for the substitute. I didn't really get a chance to comment on the substitute as we voted but I think the substitute is a great combination of amendments that address some of the equity concerns that we had regarding small BIPOC immigrant owned businesses to make sure that there was the ability to collaborate and work with certified arborists.,parks
I also appreciate the inclusion of an option to have an arborist for retention that will achieve the same ends of having that expertise on hand while not creating a barrier for those smallest businesses. So thanks for your work on the substitute as well. I did want to ask Mr. Chair of central staff here something that I'm going to start doing as more of a practice in our committees that we participate in is really asking central staff to lift up before final passage fiscal notes so that we have an opportunity to take a look one more time at the fiscal note.,parks
"Council Bill 120207, sponsored by Councilmember Peterson and myself, which will require registration for tree service providers. We have Council Bill 120265, which would extend bringing business home bill for an additional six months while permanent regulations are finalized. And finally, Resolution 32048, which ratifies the countywide planning policies.",parks
"For those not on the Land Use Committee, this legislation will increase the accountability and transparency needed to protect Seattle's trees by requiring anyone seeking to cut down or heavily prune mature trees to register beforehand with the city government. I want to thank all the supporters of the legislation who took time to call into the committee meeting and who are still sending emails of support for Council Bill 120207. In District 4 this past week, I met with the principal of View Ridge Elementary School and several parents concerned about pedestrian safety along the busy Northeast 70th Street.",parks
"I'm lucky to live in a neighborhood with lots of large trees, and I love to go for walks every day. More and more, I notice huge trees being cut down, and I always run home to tell my mom so that she can check for a permit, but so many times, a tree is down by the time I bring her back to where the tree's being cut. I get so sad when I learn that some of those trees were cut down illegally, and I know that even if they are replaced, it would take many, many decades for them to grow back to the size of the ones that were removed.",parks
"Sometimes, I wonder how many trees will be left in my neighborhood when I'm 20 or 30. Please vote yes on the bill so that some trees can get saved. Thank you.",parks
"My name's Rivers-Dysart. My family and my neighbor's family live on two... Oh, and the thing I'm addressing is the Tree Service Provider Registry Bill.",parks
"So, my family and my neighbor's family live on two adjacent properties that our landlord is selling for subdivision into three properties for development. There are three exceptional trees on these properties and two additional exceptional trees on the property line. The landlord has had two arborists come to inspect and assess the two trees at the front of the property, a western redcedar and a douglas fir growing together, two huge trees.",parks
"We call them trees in love because they're growing together. One of the arborists told me that the trees would have to go, that one of the trees would have to go, which would also, of course, kill the other one since they are conjoined. We're worried and having to keep a 24-hour watch for illegal removal of these two trees and the two trees on the property line to the north.",parks
That neighbor also is planning to sell soon for development. Please pass the Tree Service Provider Registry Bill. Thank you for considering my comments.,parks
"Good afternoon, City Council and President Juarez. My name is Colleen McClure, representing our Community Council in Northeast Seattle. We urge City Council today to vote yes on Council Bill 120207, which simply requires tree providers to register with our city.",parks
"It's an educational step that requires them to be familiar and comply with the existing tree code protections, and provides three business days notice for tree removal to the public for further examination. SDOT has had similar requirements for years to protect our city's street tree assets, and so much the same with neighboring states. And this bill also requires providers to have adequate insurance and workers comp to protect their own employees just in case of a job site accident.",parks
"The tree registration is free, and this bill represents a collaboration of several versions with the City of Seattle to provide opportunities for all of the providers to comply by using pooled resources and experts such as arborists. So please, we urge you to vote yes today to save the trees as it is these trees that may save us. Thank you.",parks
"I'm Chair of Tree PAC. I'm speaking in favor of Council Bill 120207, for the Tree Service Provider Registration. And we want to thank Council Members Alex Peterson and Dan Strauss for co-sponsoring this bill, and Council Members Mosqueda, Morales, and Nelson for voting for this bill in the Land Use Committee.",parks
"The legislation will meet one of the goals in the Resolution 31902 passed in 2019 to help increase tree protection. So we need to, however, also move on beyond this to pass the other provisions in the resolution. Example is this morning, starting at nine o'clock and still ongoing, there's a chainsaw company, a tree company working in the neighborhood cutting down trees.",parks
"When I went out to check, one of the trees was a large cedar tree, probably 70 feet tall. That was, when I asked, was quote, being topped for solar access. You know, topping is not a standard practice that you're supposed to do for saving trees.",parks
"They didn't know that the diameter of the tree, the tree was half down. Again, without a permit system and two-week notice and posting on site, we still have a complaint-based system, unfortunately. Three days notice doesn't say that they're permitted to do this, it just says this is what the company is going to do, so that needs to be clarified.",parks
"As builders, we are important partners in moving our city forward and support this bill. We look forward to working with the council in the future in developing a new tree ordinance that supports trees and desperately needed housing. Thank you.",parks
"I'm speaking on behalf of Thornton Creek Alliance, an all-volunteer organization of 160 members working to preserve and enhance the Thornton Creek Riparian Corridors in Northeast Seattle and Southeast Shoreline. Thornton Creek Alliance strongly supports Council Bill 120207, requiring registration of tree service providers and on-site posting of permitted tree cutting. This legislation represents a strong step forward in protection of our forest resources by ensuring professional treatment of trees and helping to track their numbers.",parks
"Madam Clerk, will you please read the short title, and then we'll hand it over to Council Member Strauss. Report of the Land Use Committee, agenda item three, Council Bill 120-207, relating to land use and urban forestry, adding a tree service provider registration, procedure, and requirement. The committee recommends the bill pass as amended.",parks
"This registration legislation is just the first step of a four-pronged approach to strengthen tree protections in Seattle, and I'm really happy to move this bill forward through the Land Use Committee while the other three parts of the proposal are under SEPA appeal. There are several changes that I brought forward, along with Council Member Peterson on some in our substitute and my standalone amendment that I would like to highlight, because I believe they show how our partnership made this legislation even stronger. We added a date certain of November 10th for tree service providers to register, giving them clarity to comply with this new law rather than having to do the math of when was the bill enacted and how many days did the mayor sign it and then how many days after that.",parks
"A date certain provides additional clarity. We added a requirement that when a tree service provider is removing a hazardous exceptional tree, they get a different independent tree service provider to conduct the hazard analysis and apply for the permit to eliminate any potential conflict of interest of that tree service provider. We also aligned the penalties for violations of the tree code with the penalties under SDOT's Tree Provider Registry.",parks
"And lastly, we also adjusted the public notice requirements for tree removal from three days to three business days to prevent someone from posting a notice on Friday afternoon for a Monday removal. Overall, I'm very excited for the final passage of this bill today. I'm really looking forward to continuing to work with Council Member Peterson and all of my colleagues, all of you, to continue strengthening tree protections later this year once it comes out from underneath the SEPA bill.",parks
"Colleagues, this legislation will prevent reckless tree cutting in Seattle and is a small but mighty step toward protecting the health and environmental benefits of mature trees in our emerald city. As heat waves and flooding increase with the climate crisis, we need to increase protections for our priceless tree infrastructure. And Council Bill 120207 delivers the accountability and transparency needed as we work to deliver a more comprehensive tree protection ordinance later this year.",parks
"I want to thank our Land Use Chair, Council Member Strauss, for his co-sponsorship at the introduction of this bill and for his expert enhancements. A special thank you to all the city staff who worked on this bill and to all the conservationists and tree advocates who have called into many public meetings over the past several months. In addition to this widespread support from dedicated urban forest conservationists in Seattle, such as the Audubon Society, a statistically valid survey conducted by the Northwest Progressive Institute in 2021 showed that 75% of Seattle voters support requiring tree care providers, like arborists, to meet minimum certification and training and to register with the city.",parks
"Last week, last Friday, I had the honor and privilege to join president Joe Biden at Seward Park to celebrate Earth Day alongside governor Jay Inslee, members of our congressional delegation, mayor Harrell and tribal leaders, including chairwoman, Terry Goldman from Tulalip, chairman Forsman from Suquamish, chairman Elkins from Muckleshoot, chairman Willie Frank Jr. from Nisqually and chairman Chris Peters from Squaxin Island and Estela Sero who is the CEO for the Seattle Indian health board. There are other tribal leaders there as well. So the executive order, president Biden signed an executive order to lay the groundwork for protecting some of the biggest and oldest trees in America's forests.",parks
"And the city of Seattle and the city of Memphis to discuss how to save the tree. And how to save the tree potentially illegally. This is one of those times where if you have a problem, please do email my office.",parks
"Next slide please. So A second service equity project is our tree planting program, and the current two-for-one tree planting budget from the REIT does not provide enough money to fill the existing needs or the goal to reach a net zero tree loss. So The 200-year Olmstead commemoration came up, and the Friends of Olmstead Park volunteers saw an opportunity to solicit additional funding to add trees. So",parks
"The project started, and the parks hired the Berger Partnership to identify areas of tree loss in the city, in parks, in underserved communities. And So the contractor used the current tree data and layered information from four additional maps, the heat index map, and the racial and social justice index maps that we mentioned, and then they identified locations in underserved communities with a high heat index due to the lack of sufficient tree canopy. So Along with the primary goal to plant additional trees, there are targets and benefits which also address the challenges. So",parks
"One being improved heat index in underserved communities, and this is going to be done through soliciting corporate sponsorships to help fund the additional trees and expand the tree canopy in those areas. And Then two is encouraging community partnerships through a new tree watering program that will engage the public, and it will also alleviate the high cost of watering the new trees. And Then finally is creating apprenticeship positions, which are parks job pathways, but they're targeted and open to citizens in the vulnerable communities. So",parks
I repeat this. Why? Because Apple not too much far from tree.,parks
Children is almost identical to parents. You understand what this mean? Even Apple don't far away from tree.,parks
"Okay, thank you. Steve Rubstillo is next. I see you wanna talk about trees.",parks
"And, you know, trees is an old subject. Then quite frankly, there's a lot of things that have been, I guess, much more important. And many people believe that the talk that I've heard from the city department seemed to be that the idea is to make a tree ordinance to continue to make trees large and valuable, easy to get rid of.",parks
"And the purpose of a tree ordinance that most people in the city have been looking for is the ordinance that actually protects trees of value. Because, you know, as a good environmentalist, that the large trees are the ones that actually take carbon out of the air, that actually take pollutants out of the air, that do good things and shrubs don't do much. And so this has been going on now for quite a few years, even before you were chairman of the committee.",parks
And just to pause a little bit on this slide too. Do we know how many--I mean I've seen the volunteer hours for the forest restoration and maintenance. Do we know how many trees were planted as part of these efforts?,parks
"Not specifically trees, but native plants. And we planted over 600,000 native plants in our Forested areas. And that's great.",parks
"There is people that choose not to provide their data. A lot of people, for example, might have been going to a data center for some time. They're like, you already got my data somewhere.",police
"It's tied to a location or an address, not an individual. Don't we already have a database? The RRIO run by SDCI.",police
"And then, secondly, we'll be having a second briefing and vote on a council bill that we heard in committee last time related to grants received for the Urban Areas Security Initiative. I have one amendment to the legislation that is now linked to the agenda. The amendment clarifies that expenditures made by the ordinance when spent on equipment for use by SPD and is subject to SMC 1418 regarding acquisition of surveillance technology that termination, in those cases where determination is made that the equipment is surveillance technology, the spending will not occur until after the new SIR is acted on by the City Council.",police
"The amendment notes that the expenditures made by the ordinance, which when they're submitted to the City of Seattle, are subject to the Municipal Code 1418 regarding acquisition of surveillance technologies, including a determination as to whether the equipment is a surveillance technology. That covers the four items on today's agenda. We'll now approve our agenda for our Committee meeting.",police
"There are a couple of versions of it. So we're looking at the latest version, the latest version uses technology, very similar to. The bolo wrap.",police
And we're looking at how the wrap is actually done. And it's a much safer sound and it's a much safer process. You don't want to sound like a gun.,police
There's nothing to hide here. We're not doing some sort of secret sauce math. So it will be available for public consumption to.,police
"This is an application that I think we're still in the middle of the SIR to obtain. Somewhere at the contracting level, but what this application will do is it will read and classify information from body worn camera data. And this will give us an estimation of quality of service based on an analysis.",police
"Of all recorded information. So to look at stress levels, it will be able to read and classify. Information from the volume of body worn camera.",police
And it was a technology investment that the council was considering. Cutting. My recollection is that the monitor for the consent decree weighed in.,police
"And let us know that from his perspective, that was a bad idea. And so there's, I think, high interest in the utility of this data analysis for purposes of compliance with the consent decree. One, I'm wondering if you'd talk a little bit about that.",police
"That's number Peterson. Can you talk a little bit about the, the analytical work. Related to the nylon one call analysis.",police
"And of course they're all subject to the surveillance ordinance, surveillance ordinance, but which ones would most likely trigger the, um, uh, the definition of surveillance and require a surveillance impact report. And there were four that the department thought would, uh, most likely be categorized as surveillance. Um, the first one was some cybersecurity software that the fusion center is going to purchase.",police
"Uh, another one was the wall radar and FLIR system, uh, that is going to be purchased. Uh, the third is the binocular night vision system and enhanced clip on thermal imager. And the last is the portable digital x-ray system.",police
"I think that last one we talked about a little bit at length. Um, so those four will require a surveillance impact reports, um, most likely. And, um, the second question that was asked, uh, was about whether the department had any specific policies that would prohibit the TAK system from being used to track civilians just as a refresher.",police
"That's the system that, um, allows the police department to track all of its units during an emergency. Uh, SPD has indicated that it doesn't have any policies to prohibit that because the system is only, uh, used or, uh, capable of tracking police and not civilians. And so, uh, those were the only questions on that list.",police
"And the significance is that the, um, surveillance ordinance prohibits any department from spending funds that, uh, require a SIR until such time as the council, um, acts on, on that SIR. So we've identified the technologies that are likely, um, to require a SIR. Um, we have heard from, um, executive because we were hearing both, um, that, um, they were hoping that we would act on this, um, on this grant, um, in a way that allowed them to, as soon as possible, uh, do the, do the purchases so they could close out, uh, the grant.",police
"They, they, um, note that again, they're making the commitment that any items that include technology will automatically go under the privacy review. And if, um, they are instructed to prepare a SIR, they'll complete that process before they make the purchase as required by the surveillance ordinance. But then they go on to say that if the SIR is not approved at the end of the grant term, they will coordinate with the state to request an extension from FEMA and that it is not uncommon to ask for contract extensions for grants.",police
"Thank you. Um, uh, amendment one simply establishes that, um, the projects that would be funded with UASI funds, uh, are subject to the surveillance ordinance and, um, the, uh, effect statement that I was going to describe. I think you just gave a perfect explanation of that, uh, until such time as the serves are approved, the purchases can't be made and, uh, the department has indicated that, um, if they can't spend the money by the end of the grant, which is December 31st, 2023, they'll ask for an extension.",police
"Um, as a staff memo notes, project funding decisions are made through a collaborative process involving multiple public safety emergency response agencies located throughout Snohomish, King and Pierce County. The community, in addition to recommending passage unanimously, they also adopted an amendment, noting that any equipment purchased with these funds by the Seattle Police Department is subject to SMC 1418, otherwise known as the city's surveillance technology law. The Safety and Human Services Committee will not be meeting this week, and, um, so I have no committee updates to provide, but I do want to just share a couple of department specific updates from the Human Services Department.",police
"And then we had a second briefing on March 22nd where the committee adopted amendments noting that any equipment purchased with these funds is subject to Seattle Municipal Code 1418, otherwise known as the City's Surveillance Technology Law. Okay, is that it? That's it.",police
"I'm concerned if the objective. Of the executive is that the SIPA review results. In a DNS, a determination of non-significance.",police
"If, if we don't have that in place before the DNS begins, Then I don't see how we could get a D I mean, before the SIPA review begins, I don't see how the SIPA review could possibly result. In a DNS determination. I think to your point, you know, codifying initiative 42 is something that you asked and you asked specific question early on on somebody.",police
"Um, exempting this project from I-42 that's a separate question. Then. Um, What is the goal of the executive for the SIPA process to result.",police
"In receiving a DNS, a determination of non-significance. If so, if that is what. The executive hopes happens after, as a result of the SIPA process, shouldn't we get the confirmation from the county?",police
I don't see how we can possibly. Get a DNS as a result of the SIPA review. Superintendent Williams.,police
"Um, I don't think that that's a very clear logic model. Um, You know, uh, I think in my comments, I, uh, I might've said DNS. I don't want to presume that that will be the outcome of this process for the very reasons you highlight it.",police
"That that'll be, that'll be a separate recorded document. Um, um, that would be executed. Um, and then, um, I'm going to have all sorts of people are jumping up who are probably attorneys and I'm just, um, an old army guy.",police
It extended our current automated enforcement pilot for block the box and transit lanes by two years. That program is just getting underway at SDOT. I believe they launched a handful of cameras last month after some delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic.,police
"This provides an additional two years for us to collect the data and report back on what we saw through the program without needing to feel the crunch of doing that in just a handful of months. It also created some new authority for automated enforcement. It authorizes speed cameras in school walk zones, public park speed zones, and hospital speed zones.",police
And so this is why I rely on paper and not a computer. Yes. I'm old.,police
Automated camera. Enforcement. I.,police
And where's that accounted for? We also have red light cameras. Block the box.,police
"Lock the box cameras, which are, and transit lane cameras, which are new. And then when also flag that the. We also have.",police
"All cameras, automated cameras that are that jurisdictions are allowed. To have according to their population and there are different types of cameras. They're not going to allow them in.",police
"Getting to my committee, the Economic Development, Technology and City Light Committee on Wednesday, April 27th. We will have three items on the agenda for discussion from group 4A of the surveillance impacts reports on surveillance technologies that are already in use by Seattle Public, I mean, by Seattle Police Department. Council Bills 120307, 120308 and 120309 would approve the Seattle Police Department's continued use of those technologies and accept the surveillance impact reports and an executive overview for each technology.",police
"And so per the 2017 surveillance ordinance, city departments are required to obtain advanced council approval for the acquisition of surveillance technology and to request retroactive approval if those technologies have already been in use. So those ordinances refer to those technologies. So that's it for the committee meeting and I'll just provide a brief staff report of activities that happened last week.",police
"So are there any questions about that particular request or comments? Amy, you probably made this perfectly clear, but I didn't catch it. It's not an all or nothing on dialing of the dial, the turning of the dial on these different inputs.",police
So I welcome my colleagues back to City Hall and ready to meet new people. All right. There are two council bills on the agenda for discussion today which would approve the surveillance impact reports on surveillance technologies already in use by SPD.,police
"Hi. I'm Cynthia Speece, a district six resident. The city has not engaged in an honest dialogue with the public on these surveillance technologies.",police
Most of the public's questions on group 4A technologies are unanswered. This is partly due to Seattle I.T. not allowing enough time to ask questions. There's only enough time for me to ask three out of 25 questions regarding IdaBase and two out of 15 questions from Altego and I wasn't able to ask any of my nine questions about the audio recording devices.,police
"The other half of the problem was SPD either not answering questions by saying we have to get back to you on that but then never doing so or providing incorrect information. It makes no sense that I, as a random member of the public, can have a more accurate understanding of these tools than an officer who has direct access to use them and who was selected by SPD to answer the public's questions. This implies either that SPD doesn't understand the tools or is hopefully hiding information.",police
"Regardless, the result is the same. Neither an incompetent nor a malicious city department like SPD should be trusted to operate surveillance technologies. Given the lack of honest commitment to the surveillance ordinance process, none of these three technologies should be approved by city council.",police
"Please require the public comment period for any current or future surveillance technology automatically remain open until at least one week after the public's questions are answered on IT's or SPD's website. My written comments to you included precise improvements spanning security, bystander protections, data sources, tool functionality, contractual auditing, scoping, transparency, data sharing, validation, and privacy. Oversight of the city's surveillance technologies only happens via you, council members, either voting against the technologies or passing amendments on their use.",police
"My name is Jennifer Lee of the ACLU of Washington. And I'm a member of the community surveillance working group commenting on agenda items CB 120307, 308, and 309 regarding SPD's use of audio recording systems, Maltego, and IBM i2iB. On SPD's use of audio recording systems, we are very concerned that the SIR does not specify the manufacturer or the function of devices used, which severely limits the ability of the public as well as council members to meaningfully review and approve this technology.",police
"The purpose of the Seattle Surveillance Ordinance is to create transparency and accountability around the use of surveillance technologies. And without public disclosure of the manufacturers, vendors, model names, and numbers of the audio recording devices, it is impossible for there to be meaningful public review and a council approval of this technology. On SPD's use of Maltego, we are very concerned about the potential for this tool to be used for predictive policing purposes and dragnet social media analysis, which are rife with racial bias and inaccuracies.",police
"We urge for a clear prohibition of the use of Maltego for these purposes. Additionally, there are inadequate policies to assess for errors in data analysis. The working group's recommendation for independent validation of data is not addressed by an internal SPD officer reviewing data on a case-by-case basis.",police
"On SPD's use of IBM i2iBase, we are concerned that the city's contract with IBM has not been publicly disclosed as is required by the Surveillance Ordinance. I2iBase's automated relationship analyses are likely to generate data errors that compound existing biases. While SPD has confirmed that false connections do occur, they have not shared how often they occur.",police
"There are no limits on the kinds of data that may be inputted into i2iBase, no limitations on employee access to records, no limits on usage of potentially erroneous i2iBase data, and no prohibition on the use of this technology for predictive policing. We have many other concerns with these technologies, and without answers to outstanding questions raised by the working group and members of the public, we urge council members to pause on approving these technologies. Thank you.",police
"Will the clerk please read item one and three into the record? Items number one and three, council bills 120307 and 120309, relating to surveillance technology implementation, authorizing approval of uses and accepting the 2021 surveillance impact report and 2021 executive overview for the Seattle Police Department's use of audio recording systems and IBM i2Base, briefing and discussion. Thank you very much.",police
"All right, so per the 2017 surveillance ordinance, I'm just going to give a brief description of what we're doing today. The 2017 surveillance ordinance, city departments are required to obtain advanced council approval for the adoption of surveillance technology and to request retroactive approval if those technologies have already been used. And that is the case here.",police
So council bills 120307 and 120309 would approve the Seattle Police Department's continued use of those technologies and accept the surveillance impact reports hereafter referred to as SIRs. And an executive overview of each technology. So today is the first discussion of these council bills and the second impossible vote will be in our next committee meeting on May 11th.,police
"Rebecca Boatwright, Executive Director of Risk Management and Legal Affairs. Good morning. I'm Captain Jim Britt of Technology Integration for SPD.",police
"First Seattle IT and SPD will go over a presentation about, that lays out the process for the review of these technologies and also describes each technology. I ask that you hold your questions until the end of the presentation, and we'll try to group the questions according to the technology that they pertain to. And just in case you're joining now, we have removed item two from the agenda, which refers to a technology called Maltego.",police
"Thank you, Sarah. This is Jim Loader speaking, and I am here to introduce some information about the surveillance ordinance and the process we follow specifically, or in general, but also specifically related to the technologies under review. I will be handing this off to our partners in SPD to discuss the details of the specific technologies under review today.",police
"But first, for a review of the surveillance impact report process, in 2017, as the council member already noted, the surveillance ordinance was adopted to require the city to conduct or to place additional controls and gain approvals related to the acquisition and operation of technologies that observe or analyze the movements, behavior, or actions of identifiable individuals. This ordinance provides additional direction related to the types and functions of technologies that are to be considered and classified as surveillance technologies, and the exclusions and inclusion criteria are listed here on the slides. Next slide, please.",police
"The surveillance ordinance requires the city to produce surveillance impact reports, or SIRs, that address the seven areas outlined on the screen here and follow a process that includes analysis, public engagement, public comment, and review, further review by a working group of technology and civil liberties representatives. Next slide, please. The process to develop a SIR and steward the surveillance impact report from creation to council review is about an eight to nine-month process that includes multiple stages that include public comment, working group review, an opportunity for the chief technology officer to respond, and finally, executive overview prior to being submitted to council for vote.",police
"And, yeah, as I mentioned, that takes about eight to nine months. The surveillance ordinance required the city to review existing technologies that met the definition of surveillance, and we are in the we're still in the process of doing that. So we evaluated the existing technologies in use by the city, determined which ones met the criteria, and have for the last few years been introducing them to council through this process.",police
"We are now up to group four, which is broken into two subgroups, and today we are talking about technologies that we've classified or grouped into group A. Council has already received the fire department's emergency scene cameras, ASMAC cameras, SIRs. There is a memo pending about a technology called a cyclica that is being decommissioned by SDOT.",police
"And we are here today to talk about three audio recording systems I'm sorry, two audio recording systems and IBM i2-based, it's my understanding, Maltego, has been deferred. And the final technology on the list, something called Calio, is still in development, and SPD can address the status of that if they have an update. And then I think I'm passing over to Sarah at this point to talk about the public engagement process.",police
"During that time, the drafted surveillance impact reports are posted publicly on our Seattle.gov website for the public to take a look at, as well as one-page high-level overviews of each of the technologies that are translated into the seven tier one languages. During that time, we also held two public comment meetings, which, as you can see from the table, had approximately 13 attendees in total between the two meetings. Each of those meetings is recorded and also made available after the event and posted online, as well as the slide deck materials for folks to look who were not able to attend the events.",police
"We also received two letters from the Community Technology Advisory Board, as well as the ACLU, and all of this information, along with the SIR, is then bundled up and provided to the Surveillance Advisory Working Group, where they start their review and analysis in the process. Now, I will hand it over to Captain Britt and SPD to walk you through the technologies. Good morning, everyone.",police
"Captain Jim Britt with Seattle PD. The first technology we're going to be talking about is the audio recording systems. Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.",police
"They work with SPD as a civilian, and they work with writing the surveillance impact reports on behalf of SPD by gathering information from the subject matter experts and working with IT to get the answers to the questions that are within those questions. So they're on the call as well. They didn't get a chance to introduce themselves earlier.",police
"The next slide, if we could, please. The mission of the Seattle Police Department is to prevent crime, enforce the law, and support quality public safety by delivering respectful, professional, and dependable police services. The surveillance impact, the surveillance ordinance helps us doing so by making sure that we are fulfilling our obligation to the public by meeting these needs and making sure that we're doing it in a public and transparent way with accountability and responsibility throughout the process.",police
"The first technology we'll talk about, if we can go to the next slide, is our audio recording systems. These are the devices that you've seen on television oftentimes referred to as wires, and they are audio recording devices that are hidden either on a person or in a location or on an object within an environment meant to clandestinely record conversations that at least one member of the conversation is unaware of. They have to be turned on by a person.",police
"The audio recording systems contribute to our abilities by allowing us to record conversations related to serious or violent crimes and gain information and evidence and investigative steps that would otherwise not be available to us. We don't use these on low-level, run-of-the-mill, low-level crimes. We use these on very serious and violent crimes because it's very important that we locate the persons responsible for those crimes.",police
"They allow us to pursue the resolution of criminal investigations by recording those conversations and provide key evidence when it comes time to present to trial with the prosecutor's office. Next slide, please. They're managed within one unit.",police
"I know there was some concern raised about all the officers having access to these, and that's not quite accurate. The technical and electronic support unit, the TSU, maintains control of all of these devices, and they are sent out or deployed to a detective upon request and upon completion of the warrant that they have to file with the courts. The data is collected upon completion of the mission.",police
"They're collected by the TSU, and then they pull the audio recordings from that, and then they're stored following our evidence guidelines related to digital evidence storage. Unrelated recordings that are irrelevant to the investigation are deleted, so we don't hang on to information that isn't relevant to our investigations and that aren't covered by the scope of the warrant. The protections there, audio recording devices are utilized only after the legal standards of consent and or court-issued warrants have been met, as required by the Privacy Act.",police
"I know the word consent caused some concern and some confusion. The concept here is that when a person is wearing an audio recording device or allowing an audio recording device to be placed within their vehicle, within their business, within their home, within areas that they control, they have to give us consent to do so, to have them wear that, whether it's a cooperating witness or a undercover officer or whoever might be doing so. However, still, in order to record the piece of the conversation from the person who is unaware they're being recorded, we still have to get a warrant from a judge, and that warrant, as it says in the next point, the judge gets to constrict or constrain what the nature of that recording is, how long the warrant is valid for, what areas the warrant is allowed to record, how long the recording can be allowed to go, and all the different stipulations that the courts can place upon us restricting our use of those recording devices.",police
"The use of the devices is documented by the TISU, they maintain the log record, and it's subject to audit by the OIG, the Federal Monitor, and any other internal audits at any time. So the controls are in place regarding the use of these devices, and the deployment of these devices is governed very strictly by courts and the law. We can move on to the next slide.",police
"These are all the related policies that are within SPD Manual and the Privacy Act that are governing the use of these technologies. As you can see, there's quite the list, and the SPD Manual covers a great deal of different areas, but this one technology, like many of our other pieces of equipment, touch many, many parts of our policy manual, and it's rather extensive on how we can and can't use them. Next slide.",police
"The next technology we're going to talk about, and I have a crime analyst, Spencer Hain, with me to make sure that I don't misspeak on this, IBM i2iBase, it's a link analysis software that's used to combine data stored in our databases and information gathered during criminal investigation and displayed in a manner that allows detectives to see the relationships between persons, between vehicles, between criminal incidents, between weapons that have been used in crimes, and it displays it in a format that allows a detective to make those connections. It's important to understand that this does not give us access to information we would not otherwise have access to. IBM's i2iBase does not reach out and grab information that we don't otherwise have.",police
"Later on, I have an example. If requested, I can display an example of what a result of an IBM i2iBase display would look like. We've scrubbed the identifiable information out of it, and Spencer was kind enough to bring it up with us so we can show that if requested.",police
"It does comb our records management system, which we already have and our officers have access to and our detectives have access to, and our computer-aided dispatch system, which handles all of our deployments in the field and information related to the calls that we respond to. Those are databases that are already within SPD's realm of control. IBM i2iBase reaches into those and makes connections for that.",police
"Again, not reaching into databases we don't already have access to. The next point where it mentions we can manually add additional information, this is where it relates to other agencies that have provided information related to their cases or – one of the examples Spencer mentioned was Nidenhitz, which is where we get ballistic information off of bullets that were fired at different crime scenes. When we get results of those and it mentions that they're connected to other crimes, we can manually input that information into i2iBase and it contributes to the pin board that shows us the relationships between where maybe this weapon was used in more than one offense.",police
Only authorized users can access the technology. It's limited to password logging credentials. Anybody using it is CEGIS certified and has approved access to the information that is being pinned to this pin board.,police
There's an audit log that shows the usage logs that shows when a person is logged on and what pieces of data are added to it. It's important to note that IBM i2iBase does not create any data. It simply displays it.,police
"Spencer is there anything else that needs to be added to that? No, just one clarification. I would say that i2iBase does not reach out even into our systems.",police
"We are choosing exactly which data is put into the system every night. So there's – at 3 a.m. there's just the daily update of a portion of our RMS and CAD data is being pushed into the i2iBase database. It doesn't reach out and grab anything, and like you said, it does not generate any linkages that we don't already have in our RMS system.",police
"It's a subscription service. I know there was some concern about the lack of a contract, the lack of being able to see a contract. We'll continue to look for any – I'll get any paperwork that we have related to our subscription with them, but as I understand it, because it's a subscription, we don't actually have a direct contract with IBM.",police
"Just a moment. So hopefully everybody is seeing the display that's before you right now, a simplified example of an investigative link chart. At the very top, we have a gun.",police
"This is an excellent example of how I-2iBase allows us to display the information that is already in our reach and very quickly reach to the point where we can have an identified suspect that we can further investigate. I think that's an important point. This is not going to make us go, okay, that's our guy, let's go get him.",police
And I would just note that this is something that we are and were able to do before we had I-Base. This is just much more time consuming and much more error prone because we would have to physically type in all of this information and that leads to people making mistakes. Thanks Spencer.,police
"So we're not sending this. This would not be sent to these agencies. This is for our case detective for his knowledge, his or her knowledge to know.",police
"So if Nibin, when we run the ballistics, if Nibin returned a hit out of another agency, we would be able to manually add the information that says agency Omaha, Nebraska, or agency New York, New York has additional information. And we'd be able to add that information into this display as well. Those agencies, anything that's not an SPD case was manually added to this board.",police
"It's now 2022. So what was, and this technology was in use before 2017, otherwise it wouldn't be retroactive. So what was happening, my, to get to this part of the process, what was going on in the beginning?",police
"Because this seems like a long time to, to go through a review of a technology and what happens if another vendor or a new technology comes on board, are you, that would allow for the same, it performs the same function. So my point is simply, this is a long time. And can you just explain a little bit about what happens if there are other options that are available in the intervening timeframe?",police
"And that's, that's, that's why we're looking at group four today. And, and, and we didn't look at that back in 2017. And forgive me, your second question was what happens if a new technology comes in place?",police
"Sarah, can you speak a little bit to how we're evaluating new requests? And I guess a sickle outcome might be partly an example here, which represents a technology that the department actually decided to decommission during the, during the process. Yeah.",police
"So the privacy team, the privacy program reviews technology acquisitions and makes an initial determination as to whether or not this technology, you know, meets the definition of surveillance or whether it doesn't. Every quarter we provide those, that analysis to you all by way of quarterly report and, and you all, you know, obviously reserve the right to make a different determination out of that report. So that's how we evaluate new technologies as they come in.",police
"Council member, if I could add on to that. Yes, go ahead, please. So if, if, if there is a new technology or a better way to do this, basically the, the depending on whether it's a new version or an improved version or an expanded version of say the audio recording devices, they would need to update and their SIR and the revised SIR would, because this would constitute a material change to the use of this technology, it would come back to council.",police
"If it's a completely new technology, new vendor, different vendor that just has a better way of doing it. That's also going to require a different, another SIR. Thank you very much.",police
"It's a related question and maybe you've answered it, but I just. If you have, I need to hear it again. We have the technologies that are in use that are, that we're doing a retroactive approval of, and then we have new technologies or added capacities of existing technologies.",police
"How do we prioritize which things that we're acting on? Are we trying to just deal with all the retroactive technologies first before we get to the new technologies or the added capacities of already approved technologies? Or are we, are we considering this process for the new technologies as we go as well?",police
"Who would like to take that? Sarah, can you address the issue of new technologies that have come up in the interim, as well as instances where we've determined that there's been a material change to a technology and how often that's happened and come up? Yeah.",police
"So the things are kind of happening in parallel, right? So we've been focusing primarily on getting through the retroactive lists through the process for technologies that we've already determined were surveillance, right? Owned and operated pre-2017.",police
"So that has been the primary focus, but we are still doing reviews, right? In parallel of new technologies. If we are aware of any material changes, we will go through that process of, that Lisa mentioned about updating the SIR for master list technologies that have already been approved through council.",police
"Yeah. Well, that begs the question for Captain Britt, have you bought any new technologies, surveillance technologies since 2017 or since this process was begun? No, ma'am.",police
"There have been points where we have updated existing privacy impact reports and evaluated, for example, a technology that used 3G wireless had to be upgraded to use 5G wireless. And so working with the folks at Seattle IT's privacy office and Ginger Armbruster and her team, we evaluated those updates and made sure that their capabilities were covered in the existing SIRs. But since the surveillance ordinance passed, we have not added any substantive changes or additions to our technological capabilities.",police
"And Council Member Nelson, I'll point out that in the CTO ordinance, it is Seattle IT's responsibility to conduct all technology acquisitions. And partly it's because of processes like these, our security review process. We also review technologies to make sure they're not redundant, that they're not going to cause undue support burden for the city.",police
There's a number of checks and balances that we have in place. And so all the technology purchases do get a surveillance review either to determine if they are likely to be a surveillance technology or not. And then the determinations there all get submitted to Council annually.,police
"So you all have a chance to review the ones that we determined were not surveillance and have an opportunity then to ask questions or ask us to conduct further review on those if you see anything that's concerning. And that's worth a point of clarification on my end as well. Thank you, sir, that we have purchased technologies, but every technology we've purchased, we've gone through the privacy assessment to determine with Seattle IT to determine whether it was worthy of a surveillance tag as being a surveillance technology.",police
"Since the passage of the surveillance ordinance, we have not purchased any new surveillance technologies. Correct. And with SPD and with other departments, we also engage in a process with them to determine if there are alternate ways to go about solving the problem they're trying to solve or getting the data that they're getting that don't require them to buy products or conduct surveillance operation or surveillance or surveillance like operations.",police
"And again, I say and other departments, it's not just SPD. The surveillance ordinance applies to all city departments. And we do that review for all city departments and have had many instances where we've talked the department out of acquiring something because we've determined that you can actually do what you want to do without being creepy about it.",police
"There are certain classes of technology like standard computers and phones that we've done a general assessment of. And so we don't do a review for every instance of a purchase of that technology. You know, but but yeah, I mean, everything if somebody wants to buy a nonstandard printer.",police
We ask those of all nonstandard purchases for anything we've decided as a standard. Which is just something you can just buy. We've done the review on the technologies that constitute that standard as part of the standard development process.,police
"So we're not reviewing every single laptop or phone purchase. But if you want to buy something new that we haven't reviewed yet, no matter what it is, whether it's just a plain a data set that's been accumulated from somewhere else, you know, or my go to example is a picture taking robot that roams around downtown. We're going to put that through a security or I'm sorry, surveillance review.",police
"And, you know, there have been instances where the departments have realized, well, you know, yes, we agree this this constitutes surveillance technology. And the problem we're trying to solve or the results we're trying to achieve don't really merit the level of risk that this introduces to our public. And so we're not going to go forward with that purchase.",police
"My presentation will cover a little bit of background and then for each bill, I'll focus on SPD's identification and mitigation of potential civil liberties and privacy impacts and policy considerations for each bill. So my policy considerations are going to flag what's incomplete in the SIR and focus on issues that present a significant risk of civil liberties and privacy impacts. As Chair Nelson pointed out, if you would like additional background on any of this information, you can look at reference.",police
"You can see table one in each staff memo that will talk about the working groups, privacy and civil liberties impact assessments and know whether each recommendation is already governed by federal, state or city law, whether it addresses a potential use that's not currently in practice at SPD, such as predictive policing, or if it's already largely addressed in the SIR. So I'll, you'll, this will, Council Member, yes. I didn't mean to interrupt, but can you, your voice is a little bit fuzzy or a little bit low.",police
"So in addition to being subject to the city's surveillance ordinances, the department's operations are also governed by Section 1412 of the Municipal Code, which defines the Police Department's criminal intelligence powers and functions, including how the department can collect, record, retain, and share information. So if you want information, more, more background on your department's criminal intelligence ordinances, I would point you to the background memo that Chair Nielsen pointed out is attached to your agenda materials. Next slide, please.",police
"Let's go to the next slide then. So as CTO Loader noted, each SIR has to include an adapted version of a racial equity toolkit and identify mitigation of potential racial impacts or disproportionate impacts on individuals or vulnerable communities. This identified several potential risks to civil liberties and our privacy from these devices, including the risk that private information about suspects that are suspected to be private information about suspects and victims may be acquired, and the risk that data sharing, storage, and retention could contribute to structural racism.",police
"The Police Department mitigates these impacts through its evidence procedures, anti-bias policies, and warrant requirements. Next slide, please. So for audio recording systems, you'll see three policy considerations in my staff report.",police
"The first one speaks to equity assessment metrics. For those of you who've been through this with some of the previous committee that looked at the SIRs, each of the SIRs asked the department to identify metrics that the CTO can use in their annual equity assessments of each technology. These are ways to measure disproportionate impacts and racial impacts.",police
"So none of the previous SIRs that the councils received have included any of these metrics. I think there was an assumption of a process that didn't happen. So what previous committees have done, have asked, have requested by amendment that the various departments provide a report on the proposed metrics by a specific date.",police
"The next item I've noted as a policy consideration is the mitigation of civil liberty impacts. So as I said, the SIR states that the SPD's existing policies provide sufficient mitigation. But I find that it's not really possible to fully evaluate whether the systems are being used inequitably without some historical data.",police
"So you'll see in the staff memo, one option for the council would be to ask that the SPD report on how the audio recording systems have been deployed, perhaps by incident type and location, and identify any potentially disproportionate impacts. This recommendation is consistent with some of the recommendations from the working group. The next one also is consistent with the working group recommendation, which is authentication of the recordings.",police
"So the SIR is silent on this matter. It's based, I've basically found that inaccurate identification of speakers could lead to mistakes in criminal investigations. And I also found that accidental or intentional tampering with the rendering, of course, would render inadmissible in court.",police
"So it is very important to have some way to verify that the recordings are, are taping the people you say they're taping, that there aren't any missing gaps that they would be viable evidence in a court hearing. So council has an option to ask that the police department develop policies and procedures to more formally verify the authenticity of its covert audio recordings. So I'll move on then to the iBase link analysis software, please.",police
"I think Captain Britt did a wonderful job of this. So let's go ahead and talk about the next slide, which is the civil liberties and potential disparate impacts. So in this SIR, SPD noted that the most important unintended consequence in the use of iBase is the risk that you've mistakenly identified links between individuals who may not be related to the criminal investigation.",police
"SPD says that these set of risks are mitigated by its evidence procedures, anti-bias policies, and warrant requirements. So let's talk about the policy considerations here then. You'll see, again, the equity assessment metrics need to be provided.",police
"The SIR also left blank a question that asked about how SPD would respond to public comments. So obviously, going forward, if the council chooses to, you could ask for reports to provide those sets of information by a specific date. Mitigation of civil liberties impacts is, I think, a significant policy consideration.",police
"The risk of wrongly identifying individuals has significant potential consequences and could have tragic outcomes. So, and again, in the absence of historical data, we don't really know how often this takes place. We don't have an error rate, for example.",police
"And so one way that the council could move forward on this is to obtain an independent evaluation as to the risks from SPD's current practices. And that could help set the stage to know whether SPD could benefit from additional policies and protocols to protect against those errors and any potential bias in baseline data. So that kind of an evaluation, for example, could look at a number of the areas that were flagged as being of concern by the surveillance working group.",police
"Examples include the documentation of the types and number of incidents for which SPD uses the system, the databases used by SPD, the types of data that is historically input by the officers, any sort of data validation or information as to the accuracy of the analyses, and any demographic information about the individuals and groups that are associated with the analysis. I would flag that an independent evaluation such as this would probably require additional resources. And that might be something council may want to consider in an upcoming supplemental budget.",police
"So for the contractual terms, the city has actually a template that FAS has provided that would provide terms and conditions that would protect the city's data and privacy and set privacy standards. And so any sort of vendor-provided licensing agreement probably doesn't do that. I know that ITD has been concerned in the past about use of, for example, pre-technology.",police
"That's not the case with this, but that by using a city contract, you're able to protect the city's data better than if you rely on a vendor-provided document. So one option would be to ask SPD to go ahead and develop a contract for the use of this data using the city's template. The retention schedule here, SPD uses the maximum retention period allowed or recommended by federal and state laws rather than the minimum.",police
"So they retain these records for five years. If you retain, this could result in a lot of out-of-date records potentially being on here that could be inaccurate, particularly if there's no way to validate the information each year. So one way to go forward with this, should council choose, would be to ask SPD to develop a revised retention policy that complies instead with the minimum retention period, and then perhaps adds an annual validation of records retained for more than one year.",police
"So that's actually a separate department from SPD. Both departments are subject to the federal rules for data sharing, but a formal internal agreement would provide greater transparency about how data is handled and kept secure. So should council see fit, you could ask SPD to develop maybe a more formal MOA or MOU with the Community Safety and Communications Center as to how data will be shared and protected.",police
"Hi, Chloe. Thank you so much. So on slide 5, I know one of the recommendations from the working group was that SPD disclose the names of manufacturers, vendors, model names, and model numbers of the audio reporting systems.",police
"And the response from SPD is that they want to avoid the risk of countermeasures as it relates to the audio recording system. Can you explain a little bit about what that means? I'm going to direct, I'm assuming you're asking the police department for that explanation.",police
"Yeah, if we're required to disclose information about these devices, exactly what they are, make, model, people are able to gather information about them and would be able to develop ways to defeat or prevent us from using these items effectively. Thank you. A couple other questions, if I may.",police
"Yes, appreciate it. As it relates specifically to the recommendation that there be a specific prohibition on the use of biometric technology on or with audio recordings, appreciate that SPD has explained that they do not use biometric technology in conjunction with the recording systems. But wouldn't it still be an action for the council that we could take to specify in a way that's consistent with the working group recommendations that should there be a time that SPD might consider using biometric technology that we state proactively that we don't support that?",police
"Or would that be sort of inconsistent with the approach that we use for these surveillance technologies, which is basically it is prohibited until we say it's not? Council Member, I think you're right. I think that would be a little bit of belt and suspenders, but sometimes that's an important policy decision to make that the council could make.",police
"And you're right, if they chose to, if SPD wanted to use biometric technology, they would need to submit a surveillance impact report. And I believe we did do sort of a belt and suspenders approach for facial recognition technology. Yes.",police
But would that be an amendment to this particular piece of legislation because or would that be a separate policy process? I think it would depend on whether you wanted to limit the prohibition to the use of biometric technology associated with audio recording systems or associated with any use of biometric technology. Got it.,police
"Council Member Herbold, do you have other questions? I do, but I'm going to just pause for a moment just to see if there are other questions about this particular technology. My other questions are related to the other.",police
"Could you go back to the mitigating of civil liberties? And this applies to both of the council bills because that is mentioned in there. So are these, when we talk about civil liberties, these are all technologies that have already been, these investigations, you're using these because there has been a warrant.",police
"I mean, can you, is that, that's a broad term mitigating of civil liberties. So what does the warrant process provide for any kind of mitigation of violations of civil liberties and the privacy ordinance that also governs the use of some of these technologies? That is for SPD, I think.",police
"Yes, certainly. The warrant process, the detective when sitting before the judge has to show why they believe this person has relevant information, why we should be allowed to record the way we're recording. And then the judge gets to determine whether we're allowed to create a recording without the person's knowledge, where and when we're allowed to do that.",police
"They can either say, within 30 days, you have to serve this warrant within 30 days. They could say, you can't do it in privately controlled areas. You have to do it in public.",police
"We go to the judge with this request, and the judge decides what the limits are on our ability to create this recording. Thank you. Council Member Herbold, are you ready for another question or any of my other colleagues, please?",police
"The I-BASE combines data from other sources at SPD, and it looks like the I-BASE retains the compilation of the data in comparison to the sources it's pulled from for the maximum of five years, and I'm wondering, is there a minimum? Lisa, you suggested that there may be an interest in asking for a retention schedule that is different than the maximum, and I believe we've done that for some of the other technologies as well. So there's a state retention schedule, and the minimum retention for those varies depending on the nature of the case, but I'll also turn that over to SPD if you wanted to add to that statement.",police
"So, for example, murder cases, the records have to be held much longer than shoplifting cases. I mean, it really depends on the nature of the record. And at risk of speaking outside of my lane, I would defer to SPD's legal department to make sure that we had the factual information correct on a case-by-case status, but Ms. Kaye is correct.",police
"The retention is set by the nature of the crime and state law. Thank you. Does Rebecca, do you want to add on anything here?",police
"Captain Britt is correct. It's on a case-by-case basis and is established by the state records retention guidelines. Well, we don't have anybody in the prosecutor's office here, but I mean, it seems to me not knowing how long it takes a case to be held.",police
"What if there is an allegation that we got the wrong guy, for example? I mean, is, and so is the idea that you want the records available for possible appeals? That's the nature of why the, why it's a case-by-case.",police
"We are required, for example, in a homicide case, we're required now by law to require the records to be held. In a homicide case, we're required now by law to retain all evidence related to that case, including all investigative files related to that case until all appeals processes are concluded. One of the reasons our vehicle processing room oftentimes gets inundated with vehicles that have to be held for a lengthy period of time, but related to this, any information related to this would need to be held associated with the investigative file through the length of the required retention.",police
"And you're correct, Councilmember, it would be because of the need for appeals. And just to clarify, the data in I-BASE would be not the actual data that's going into the investigation. Any link charts created would then be provided to the detective, and it's his or her responsibility to then hold onto that throughout the lifetime of the case.",police
"Any manually added information would still, in I-BASE, would still be deleted after five years, and it would only live on on the link chart that he has. Thank you. Colleagues, do you have any other questions or comments about either the technologies or the policy considerations before us?",police
"First of all, in terms of the contracts, those are generally, because IT controls the procurement of these technologies, the contracts are drafted primarily by Seattle IT, and they're the ones that are looking at the use of the data within the system and whether the vendor has access to and for what uses they do. And that's part of their privacy and data control analysis. So that's not something that is controlled by SPD as I understand it.",police
"Secondly, on the slide that's on the screen right now with the data sharing with the CSCC, the Community Safety and Communications Center, SPD retains operational control over the computer aided dispatch system. That is an SPD system. It is used by the CSCC, but we're the ones that have the data management responsibilities and control over that system.",police
"So we do not have – the data sharing goes from us to them, not the other direction. Could I ask you, Brian, is that – is there a written agreement as to that operational control that SPD retains? It's – it has never changed during the decoupling.",police
"Right now, SPD is still maintaining the operational – all the administrative systems for CSCC. And so I don't think there is a specific – there would be an agreement to transfer the control to CSCC rather than an agreement to leave it at SPD. So to my knowledge, that document does not exist.",police
"And just to clarify, the two people that have access to the – to I-BASE currently are me and one other civilian analyst. We're both civilians, not detectives. And I looked through the agenda that was provided.",police
"So I appreciate those concerns. I think many of the concerns, though, have been sort of driven by a misunderstanding of what exactly I-BASE is and what it does. It is not smart.",police
"There's no algorithm. It doesn't make any sort of analysis. Any analysis done using I-BASE is manually done by us, the two civilian analysts.",police
"I think it sounds like a lot of the concerns, including some of the public comments, were driven by sort of the sales pitch information that's provided by IBM on their website, which is at best an exaggeration of what I-BASE can do. For example, there was concern raised over heat maps. The maps don't work.",police
"Another concern was over social network analysis. The way we bring the data in, we cannot use it for social network analysis without getting too technical. Social network analysis basically requires you to have linkages between people, so two people that know each other, and then you analyze those social networks.",police
"That is not how we bring the data into I-BASE. We bring it in only based off of records management system data, which is event-based. So a person is arrested in an incident.",police
"If another person is arrested in that incident as well, they're both linked to the incident, but you cannot run SNA on that. So that doesn't work. In addition, as has been stated, we have no relationship with IBM anymore.",police
IT has the contract with them. They have no access to our data whatsoever. I'd also say that no police action is ever taken just based off of any chart generated by us through I-BASE.,police
"But we have nothing to hide. I welcome any oversight, anyone that would like to see exactly how we're doing it. I wish I could give a demonstration here, but it is all CEGIS data, so we're pretty restricted in who is actually able to see that data.",police
"Beyond that, yeah, we have nothing to hide, and I look forward to further engagement with anyone that wants to ask us about what we're doing. Thank you. When you were talking about maybe some of the concerns were based on messaging on the packaging, it raised a question for me.",police
"Nope, nope, nope, nope. Okay, so go on, Lisa. I was just going to mention, I mean, we do have at least seven more technologies from SPD that will be coming forward this fall, and I would encourage the executive to potentially connect the subject matter experts to the working group earlier in the process so that they can help focus their questions on once they've received full information.",police
"Yeah, it does exist. So subject matter experts from the departments are invited to the public engagement sessions. And Sarah, do you happen to remember for this technology in particular regarding the working group, what were their opportunities for the subject matter experts to meet directly with the working group, I guess, on this tranche of technologies, but also in general?",police
"Yeah, so typically when we open a public engagement window, public comment period, we do inform the working group that we're opening the window, encourage them to not only show up to the meetings, right, which they're informed about with the joining links in our virtual world, but also to try to help encourage and drive participation from their connections and folks that they know in their community as well. So there's no direct presentation to the working group from the subject matter experts, but they are encouraged, invited, and informed that there will be a presentation and an engagement with the departments with the technologies under review through that public comment window. So yeah, I guess the short answer is yes, the opportunity exists for both members of the public and members of the working group to have engagement, receive information directly from, and then engage with the subject matter experts representing the technologies.",police
"And why would there not be an actual presentation from the department purchasing, seeking to purchase the technology, or in the case of retroactive technologies, the department using the technology? Why would that not be a component of that engagement? You mean a presentation to the working group directly?",police
"Okay. Thank you. Well, in this case, I am hearing SPD saying they wish they were invited to give a presentation, so it might—I mean, I don't think every nuance of a public engagement process needs to be codified in an ordinance, and maybe we might just decide collectively that it's a good idea to do so that this subject matter expertise isn't just held by city staff working in the departments using the technology, but that it's shared with members of the public who have responsibility for commenting on these technologies.",police
"Am just, to be candid, I do not want to speak on behalf of CSB and how they move that data, because that is not a thing that I am privy to or part of. We Become aware of it in that meeting, though. So A follow-up on that. Do",police
"We are meeting this week, however, on May 11th at nine 30. And there are two items on our agenda. Per the 2017 surveillance ordinance, city departments are required to obtain a advanced council approval for the acquisition of surveillance technology and to request retroactive approval if those technologies have already been in use.",police
"And that's what we were talking about on Wednesday. Uh, council bills one two zero three zero seven and one two zero three zero nine would approve the Seattle police department's continued use of audio recording devices and link analysis software and accept the surveillance impact reports and an executive overview for each technology. And this will be our second discussion and possible vote on these bills tomorrow.",police
"There are two items on the agenda today, both a continuation of our conversation last month at our last meeting on April 27th on group 4A of the surveillance impact reports on surveillance technologies already in use by the Seattle Police Department. If there's no objection, the agenda will be adopted. All right, hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted.",police
"My comments are regarding both council bills. I support all nine proposed amendments across these two surveillance technologies. Regarding the undercover audio recording devices, amendment three could be improved to include the device model names, which would be straightforward for SPD to provide given the purchase orders would include that.",police
"Regarding iBase, amendment two could be improved to include with the tally the incident case types such as homicide, burglary, etc. Both these surveillance technologies could benefit from council members adding oversight by the requirement that they receive an audit of their use and scoping their use to only cases involving a violent or serious offense. While at the last committee meeting, SPD framed their current use of iBase as being limited based both on officers' time and poor quality of certain features from within iBase, but neither of those are set in stone.",police
"This means that if SPD had more staff and or if certain parts of iBase function better, then SPD would be using those more concerning features tomorrow. As such, the responsibility falls on city council to add official guardrails. Additional oversight of iBase should be added by a couple members prohibiting the use of predictive policing, prohibiting pulling in bulk data from external data sources into iBase such as data brokers, prohibiting pulling in data from automated license meter geolocation databases, and requiring that the contract governing SPD's acquisition of iBase be posted publicly.",police
"Lastly, and most importantly, council members should require that the public comment period deadline for any surveillance technology extends until at least one week after all the public's questions have been answered, either on the Seattle IT Privacy Department's or SPD's website. The vast majority of the public's questions on these technologies are still unanswered. SPD is dodging one of the key purposes of the surveillance ordinance, which is to provide transparency and accountability.",police
"In order to address this problem, the public comment period should be tied to SPD providing answers to the public's questions as an official deliverable instead of tying the public comment period purely to a calendar date. Please see my emails to you for detailed recommendations you should take on these surveillance technologies. Thank you.",police
"And we'll now proceed to our items of business. And since the items are related, will the clerk please read both items into the record? Items number one and two, council bills 120307 and 120309 relating to surveillance technology implementation, authorizing approval of uses and accepting the 2021 surveillance impact report and 2021 executive overview for the Seattle Police Department's use of audio recording systems and IBM i2 base, briefing discussion and possible vote.",police
"Thank you very much. So to introduce these items, just a little bit of background information. In 2017, the city council passed ordinance 125376, otherwise known as the surveillance ordinance, requiring city departments to obtain advance council approval for the acquisition of surveillance technology and to request retroactive approval of those technologies that have already been in use when that bill was passed.",police
"Council bills 120307 and 120309 would approve the Seattle Police Department's continued use of those technologies and accept the surveillance impact report, SIR and an executive overview for each technology. At our last meeting on April 27th, we had a joint presentation from Seattle Information Technology and the Seattle Police Department that went over the process for reviewing technology, surveillance technologies and describing the technologies that these particular SIRs were concerned with and also described basically what they did, how they worked and how the overall process floats. So they also went over the related laws and policies that authorize and limit SBD's use of such technologies.",police
"So the reason for the city's surveillance ordinance is to identify, prevent and reduce or mitigate violations of civil liberties that could result from the use of these technologies and in this case what SBD is using in the course of investigations. Surveillance technologies are defined as surveillance technology, this is from the ordinance, means any electronic device software program or hosted software solution that is designed or primarily intended to be used for the purpose of surveillance. So as we deliberate on these amendments the question I bring to the table is whether or not do these amendments better protect the civil liberties or privacy of individuals subject to an investigation in which these technologies are being used.",police
"So as you mentioned, Chair Nelson, if it suits you, I will describe the first set of amendments which apply to council bill 120307. This is the bill that would approve the police department's continued use of audio recording devices and accept the surveillance impact report. As you mentioned, these devices are used under the authority of a warrant to covertly record conversations during a criminal investigation.",police
"Great. Okay, so and I will just be projecting each amendment as they come forward for discussion so members can see the wording. Amendment one would ask the police department to report by October 31st of this year on how the department ensures authenticity of these recordings and also ensures the accurate identification of recorded individuals.",police
"As you may recall from my staff report, SPD advised me that the police department's case detectives are responsible for identifying individuals and for reviewing any recordings obtained from these devices. With that, I will turn the mic over to Council Member Herbold if that's your... Yes, please do.",police
"I do, again, come back to the questions that I had before is, how will this report? Well, basically, I'll just ask it in plain English. How are recordings already authenticated?",police
What extra steps would this amendment require them to do? In what ways is the authenticity of recordings that have been in use? Have they been problematic in the past?,police
"I mean, I just need more information about why this amendment is important considering that it does ask for some work by SPD, they're short-staffed, et cetera, et cetera. So I just wanted to get a better understanding of... It absolutely only asks SPD to tell us what they're already doing.",police
"It doesn't ask them to do anything more. Each of these amendments only asks SPD to tell us what they're already doing, how SPD ensures authenticity. We're not asking them to change any policies, just to tell us how they do this function.",police
"Well, it does ask for a report by October 31st, 2020, and so that is asking for an additional action. So again, I will restate my question and ask a subject matter specialist if you can get to perhaps try to answer my questions, because that I do believe we do... I think the amendment is designed to ask the questions that you are asking so that we get exactly that information.",police
"Okay. Well, the recordings in question are part of standard investigative process. So I would suggest that when we are asking how SPD ensures the authenticity of recordings and the accurate identification of individuals in audio recordings obtained, are we talking about in general, how are audio recordings authenticated in general practice or in each recording?",police
"And I will also ask Captain Britt if you have any input here. Thank you, Council Member. Like you said previously, the authenticity of the recording is established by standard investigative process.",police
"Anytime we're conducting an investigation, any evidence that's obtained, including audio recordings, is validated for its authenticity. Further, when we go to court, it's validated by the court process regarding admissibility. Defendants in court have the opportunity to challenge the validity.",police
"We make our case in court and ultimately a judge in pretrial motions determines the validity of the audio recording. So there are checks and balances in the process even beyond our involvement in that. But when we're creating a recording or when we're seeking the recording, the standard investigative process, which could include witness testimony and information from officers on scene or detectives involved in the investigation, would all feed into validating that audio recording as part of the investigative process.",police
"I mean, I just want to echo what Captain Britt has said. There's no technological mechanism to ensure this authenticity. This is done through the investigative process, either the declaration of the officer that wore a wire or the CI that wore the wire.",police
"And all of this is done pursuant to a warrant. So the target of the use of the wire is already pre-established by the warrant application. And then, as Captain Britt said, the use of this is in terms of prosecution where both the department through the prosecutor has the obligation and the burden to prove the authenticity of this and present it under a beyond the reasonable doubt standard.",police
"Do you feel, having heard the response from SPD here, that that gets at the intent of the working group? Or is there some additional sort of texture, if you will, to the desire to understand the authenticity of records process? I wasn't party to the working group's deliberations, but in just reading their comments and their concerns, as well as some of the comments raised by members of the public and just doing my own research, I think that the question would be really whether any of that authenticity is verified and how it's verified before it ever gets to the court.",police
"So I understand that the court will make a ruling and that that is a very strong check on the use of these, particularly through the warrants. But I suspect that the working group may have been concerned about how information could be promulgated potentially inaccurately if for some reason these recordings weren't authentic and that that inauthenticity wasn't found until it came to the court. Does that make sense?",police
"And I think the surveillance impact report did speak to investigative procedures, but those aren't transparent necessarily. And as to Mr. Maxey, I don't think the council can amend the surveillance impact report as that's supposed to be documenting how the police department operates. And so we would potentially, if you wanted to update this or now, we might want to hold off on.",police
"Go ahead. For convenience, I only have the I-based SIR printed in front of me, but does the SIR for audio recordings respond to a concern by the working group on this matter? No.",police
"Is that what you said? Not before investigation, before. SPD referred to sort of the inherent controls existent in the court process and the limitations around getting warrants, due process, etc.",police
"You see amendment two on your screen now. This would prohibit the use of biometrics on or with the Seattle Police Department's audio recording systems unless council approves their use through acceptance of a revised or a new surveillance impact report. And you'll see that biometrics is defined here as technology used to identify a person based on physical characteristics, which may include a person's fingerprints, DNA, retinas, voice, or face.",police
And I was advised by SPD as I was preparing my staff report that the police department does not currently use any type of biometric technology in conjunction with these devices. I will turn this over to the sponsor. And I do see Mr. Stringer's hand up as well.,police
"Good morning, council members. I just was seeking some clarification on the, I don't know if my video on or not, but I was seeking some clarification on what the use of biometrics means as far as like collecting biometrics and aggregating that data with audio recording systems or using any kind of biometric identification in conjunction with the audio recording devices. So just seeking some clarity on that.",police
"Sure. Just to start with what I understand to be the answer, and Lisa, correct me if I'm wrong, we're speaking kind of broadly as it relates to the use of biometrics. And we're referring to the acquisition of technology that would allow the department to identify a person based on physical characteristics, which may include a person's fingerprints, DNA, retina, voice, or face.",police
"And so this is really focused again on the acquisition of technology that would allow you to allow SPD to do this. And I think this is what we discussed in our last committee meeting as sort of a belts and suspender approach. I think everybody, we all agree that this would be a separate technology.",police
"And under the surveillance ordinance, the understanding is that SPD would have to come back and go through that process of developing a SIR for that. But much like we did on facial recognition technology, with the co-sponsorship of council member Peterson when this work was going through his committee, we sort of took that belts and suspender approach with facial recognition technology as well in order to offer some assurances to community members who sort of want the council to make that extra statement above and beyond just the recognition that these technologies go through this process. Thank you.",police
"Well, Mr. Maxey. So I think council member Herbold is correct that this is already part and parcel of the requirements of the surveillance ordinance itself. We could not acquire technology that allows us to do this absent another tour of the surveillance ordinance and coming back to this body.",police
"But I worry that some of the phrasing of this could have some unintended consequences. For example, we do take DNA, we do take fingerprints, and we do have technology that's used to examine that DNA. And if that's part of the validation process of who the person that we are recording, for example, if we had a room that we can't see into and we believe there's only one person in there, we could rely on DNA technology analysis to say the person that was in that room was so-and-so that corresponds to the voice that we're presenting to a court.",police
"So it's not so much a technology, it's more of an investigative process that we discussed in the prior amendment that could be used to validate this. Similarly, the voice, we do not have technology that will compare voices, but we might have a prior recording of a person and then use that against the audio recording to validate that we have the correct person. When I said earlier that it was broad, I guess I failed to recognize it is broad as it relates to biometrics on or with the audio recording systems.",police
"I think Mr. Maxey is correct that there is some ambiguity there in terms of... I think the initial response that the department doesn't use biometrics with this probably was intended at the very high level, but in terms of when you get down to the actual analysis of how you're going to authenticate or how you're looking at these recordings, it would seem that these analytical tools are in fact used, is what I heard Brian say, Mr. Maxey say. Am I accurate there, Mr. Maxey?",police
Okay. We're looking at amendment three right now. This would ask the police department to identify the manufacturers and vendors of the audio recording systems that are described in the surveillance impact report that would be approved by or would be accepted by the council.,police
"And as was mentioned at your first hearing, the police department prefers not to publicly disclose this information to avoid the risk of countermeasures and due to safety concerns for officers and cooperating witnesses. I believe Council Member Herbold saw asking for manufacturers and vendors at a kind of a 30,000 foot level as opposed to a level of specificity that would be risky to the police officers. Yep.",police
Just a much more narrowly tailored ask that hopefully does not have the same vulnerabilities that SPD had expressed concern with last time. How is this a narrower ask? It's only requesting the identity of the manufacturers and vendors.,police
"Thank you, ma'am. And while I appreciate the council member's efforts to broaden the ask to protect that, this request still has the potential to cause the same risks that were identified previously. Should a manufacturer or a vendor that is disclosed in this process have a limited number of devices or similarly operating devices, it would still lay us open for the potential for countermeasures or dangers to our cooperating witnesses or our undercover officers that utilize this technology.",police
"Isn't this information that would be disclosable under a public disclosure request? It's just... That would depend on the nature of the public disclosure request, the nature of the investigation involved, and the decision of the judge overseeing the case.",police
I'm saying the city makes a purchase and who you are making the purchase from is public information. I'll defer to Becca Boatwright for the questions on the legality of disclosure. Rebecca?,police
"I'm sorry, could you repeat the question? The information requested in this amendment, simply the manufacturers and vendors of the purchased audio recording systems, that's public information, correct? It completely depends.",police
"We would be providing third-party notice to the vendor and the vendor would most likely intervene in the request. Okay. Back to my framing question, how does the listing of the identities of the manufacturers and vendors of the recording systems better protect the civil liberties and prevent against disparate impacts?",police
"I think the recent experience the city has had with Acela is a really good example why it's important for the city to know who we're doing business with. That particular contractor who we no longer do business with has a history of illegal sales, bribery, and privacy advocates have been raising the flag about our involvement purchasing these products from Acela. Because of that transparency, we've made different purchasing decisions with public tax dollars.",police
"Pedals permitting, I was like, wait, putting my IT hat on. Yeah, I think, you know, with that, and the working group has expressed concerns, again, about what devices are used. Council Member Nelson, to kind of answer your question, I think it helps them kind of put together, if I'm understanding their perspective of what is presented and what is the capabilities of the technology to assess it.",police
"I think that being said, a lot of these technologies, regardless of manufacturer or vendor, are kind of in the same, it's a microphone that records, right? And I think the intent of that ask is to kind of validate that what are other options out there, what devices are being used? I think it's one of those wanting to verify and provide oversight is the reason behind the ask.",police
"But I think that has to be balanced with SPD's request that that information not be given due to potential countermeasures. So I think that's the real, the balancing question here. Thank you.",police
"Well, I am concerned about the potential of rendering the functionality of the the functionality of these devices, moot, if people can find a workaround and figure out how not to be recorded. And so that is the question that is driving me. Because all as was mentioned before, the some vendors perhaps only make one product.",police
"So it would be fairly easy to get the specs on that product, even if you don't. Even if the the more broad ask has been narrowed to simply manufacturers and vendors and not making model, for example, Amari. Sorry, that was my hand still up.",police
"This amendment is similar to all the amendments passed for previous surveillance impact reports, which also omitted to provide metrics to the chief technology officer for that office's use in the annual equity assessments. So this amendment would ask the police department to provide those metrics to the clerk by the end of this year. Thank you, Lisa.",police
"Yeah. So this is just, again, this follows the requirements that we have included on reporting on the metrics that they use for annual equity assessments that they already do, they're required to do. And it just is replicates the amendments that we have included in the CSRS for previous technologies approved by the council.",police
"So just, it's a template amendment, it's a template amendment, hopefully not a big deal. I have not looked at those other CSRS. So could somebody please speak to whether or not you could just use the other the other metrics for this technology for this group of technologies?",police
"I think if I may, Madam Chair, the issue is that the CSRS has a number of questions that the department's answer. One of the questions is what will be the metrics that you're going to give this chief technology officer so they know how to measure the equity impacts of your particular device. Those metrics have never been provided in any of the CSRS that have come to council to date.",police
"I think Omari explained this in a previous iteration that the departments were kind of waiting to see what the council was going to do before they provided those metrics. And so the council has kind of provided a nudge each time saying we really would like you to give the metrics so that the CTO knows how to do their assessment. So basically, are we trying to get at whether or not the use of this technology is used more often in in investigations in which a particular group of people are being investigated compared to another group of people?",police
"Is that because this is where we're looking at technology technology and use during an investigation? So is that the pool that we're looking at to apply the metrics to? Yes, and you'll see, I mean, the CTO has done equity assessments, I believe, to date of one or two of the surveillance technologies already.",police
"I might ask Omari to speak a little bit more to that. But yes, it's basically broadly looking at any data they can track in terms of disproportionate civil liberties impacts from the use of these technologies. OK, Omari, you had your hand up first, please.",police
"Yeah, so I can speak a little bit more to the equity metrics. So by the ordinance, the CTO is required every year by September 15th to submit the surveillance technology community equity impact assessment and policy guidance report. We call it the equity impact assessment for short.",police
They get a draft and they provide feedback recommendations on it. I think the idea is these amendments and the CER provides an opportunity for departments to provide to us the metrics under which we will evaluate them by as kind of an oversight function. So this is kind of how the equity measurement is baked into the ordinance because the CTO is required to take a look at that every year and see are there disproportionate usage patterns in some of these technologies.,police
"That is fine. All right, great, thank you so much. With that, I move amendment three as listed on the agenda requesting the department to provide a report to the clerk identifying the manufacturer and vendor of the audio recording systems in the SIR report.",police
"I appreciate that and just happy to, for the record, I appreciate the courtesy second, thank you, and I don't really have anything more to add. This is not information that would have a negative impact on a law enforcement investigation. This is information that I believe is public information because it is simply the name of a manufacturer who is also the vendor.",police
It's not information about a specific product and it's about the identity of the vendor who SPD purchases products from and that is public information because it relates to the use of our tax dollars. It is not information that is privileged or can be withheld to my understanding by the request of a third party. Thank you.,police
"Are there any other comments from my colleagues? What I heard Rebecca say is that manufacturers could move to basically try to block the release of this information. Is that correct, Rebecca?",police
I'd like to move amendment four as listed on the agenda requiring the police department to provide a notification on the metrics that will be provided to the CTO for use in the annual equity assessments that they do. I second that. Thank you.,police
"So this is an amendment to Council Bill 120309 that would approve IBM's i2iBase link analysis software. So it would approve the ongoing use of this and accept the surveillance impact report. As you heard last week, this technology is used to during criminal investigations to help detectives visualize connections between individuals, known entities, vehicles, locations, and other data.",police
"Okay. Amendment one would ask the police department to report by January 31st of next year on data and records retention policies and or guidelines that are applicable to the use and the operation of this technology. The amendment specifically asks the police department to identify, to the extent feasible, retention policies that comply with the minimum retention period allowed by state and federal law and define a clear process for deletion of records after the retention period's been expired.",police
"And you heard during your first meeting that the police department retains manually added data after five years, which is really the federal maximum requirement. The state law enforcement records retention schedule for intelligence files, for example, requires retention until no longer needed for agency business. But federal law allows for a retention period of up to five years.",police
"Well, okay then, but let's not get too far away. So I guess I will ask a specific question about this because this particular one while we're on it. So the, the question is will records be retained for five years maximum or three years maximum?",police
"If those records are no longer available, if the city is trying to defend ourselves or, or aid in, in, in defending a suspect that was subject to these investigations. So can the, the amendment doesn't, doesn't promulgate a particular record retention policy. It asks, it simply asks what the records retention policy is.",police
"It says the report identifies a retention policy that complies with the minimum policy that complies with the minimum retention period allowed by state law and federal law, but but also includes a clear deletion oversight process to ensure deletion of manually added data after the specific specified retention period. So, I mean, it speaks to both the minimum retention period allowed by state and federal law. Okay.",police
"SPD, what would be the real life impact of this? So I guess I'll, I'll jump in first here and I'll let Captain Britt clean up anything I say. I mean, there's a couple of things in play here.",police
"One is when we generate an I2I base link analysis that is associated with the underlying investigative file and the retention for that document would track with whatever the investigation is. So for example, homicide cases are, are, are maintained in perpetuity. So if this was a homicide case, we would, it would track with that.",police
"If it were something else, it would track within the retention for that type of case. So this request, as I understand it, is for us to identify what the retention policies are and present that back to the clerk. And I see no problem doing that.",police
"Let's go on to the next one, please. Thank you, Madam Chair. Amendment two would ask the police department to report by October 31st of this year, and the number of incidents over each of the past three years for which this software was deployed.",police
"I think the only thing I have to add on that is that this is recommendation 12 from the working group. It is not an issue addressed in the SIR, and it is been requested because of a belief that it is important to under, for the public to understand how this technology is being used and the number of incidents per year. Again, this data would vary.",police
"It's data. It's not, it's not personally identifying data, and it would be governed by public disclosure laws anyhow. Okay.",police
"So to remind people, and I think that perhaps a description of, of the technology is, is warranted here because this, my understanding is that IBASE is, allows the department to see linkages. It doesn't, IBASE is not a technology that, that actually captures information from individuals or transmits it, et cetera. So I, it's kind of like a, it allows for officers to see the relationships between individuals and, and previous cases, et cetera.",police
"I'm happy to withdraw this one to discuss further with the working group. The, the data set that can be analyzed that perhaps would satisfy the transparency requests here. If not, if not incidents, what I'm happy to take, take this amendment back to them for additional refinement.",police
"Thank you, Madam chair. Amendment three would ask the police department to report by January 31st of next year on the employee access policies and or guidelines applicable to the use and operation of this software. It asks the report to identify to the extent feasible, a policy or procedures to prevent employee access to I2 based records that are unrelated to their assigned investigations.",police
"Moving on to amendment four, please. Amendment four is the same equity metrics amendment that you considered for the audio recording devices. Nothing more to say about that one.",police
Okay. This amendment is sponsored by council member Strauss. It would request the ask the executive to include funding in the mid year supplemental budget for the office of inspector general to retain a consultant to evaluate and report on the civil liberties risks associated with SBD's use of this software.,police
"They'd ask for the report by March 31st of next year. The request asks that the report include an analysis of the accuracy of the data that is manually input into the software, the accuracy of the linkages that are identified by users of the software, and demographic information about the individuals and groups identified in the visualizations that are produced with the software. We'll turn this over to Council Member Strauss.",police
"Amendment five, this amendment would request that the supplemental budget include funding for an independent evaluation on the risks associated with iBase technologies, including the risks to civil liberties, data accuracy, and the accuracy of the linkages that the system identifies. The cost of such an assessment is around $100,000, similar to other consultant reports we've funded. And I know from funding the water safety study this last year that those numbers can change.",police
"I think that it is important to have this assessment, as any assessment would be overseen by the Inspector General for Public Safety, even though it is completed by an independent consultant. I recognize that this request would require funding in a difficult budget year, and my amendment would not prohibit the use of this technology. It would only make it clear that the assessment is needed and that we should work to fund it, while there would be a small fiscal impact.",police
"If we're able to secure funding for such a risk assessment, the reality is that if this technology is misused, it would send someone to prison wrongfully. I don't necessarily think that's going to happen. I just find that having this third-party accountability does provide additional protections for SPD, for the City of Seattle, and for the people of our city.",police
"How is this? Have you talked to the Inspector General about this? I guess one of my questions is, after passage of the SIRs, then it's now on their plate to evaluate for a year or three, the deployment of these technologies, and they take into account a lot of the, I think, the questions that we've been talking about now, disparate impacts, and so on.",police
"So, I did have one. IBASE links different investigations, so if data is entered into a case, as we presented last time, someone in Kent, but the bullets were found in Seattle, I mean, would they, I'm just wondering, would this consultant report also verify the processes by which and the accuracy of by which data is input into cases in other jurisdictions? I think that's probably a question for the development of this evaluation, and, you know, what I can tell you is that growing up, there were two people in the city of Seattle with my name and with my father's name.",police
"I would regularly receive mail for that person. My father would regularly receive mail for the other person, you know, and this was in a day and age where things were a little bit more simple, and this day and age was so many levels of technology being able to connect. I think Mr. Maxey described it at the last meeting is, if you'd see those old detective videos of linking, you know, pictures on a wall and linking with the string from each thing to another, in a world where technology is now doing that for us, I do think that it is important that we have independent evaluation to ensure that we're not making the old mistakes that I had described about having two people with the same name or anything else, but the scope of the evaluation, I think that that is iterative, and if you have input, I think it would be welcome.",police
"Oh, you know, we didn't speak up earlier because it's not really our place to say what the OIG should be doing. We accept that they have unfettered access to our systems for efficient oversight. I just, in hearing the description of this, though, it sounds like this is almost an audit of our investigations rather than an audit of the use of this technology, because when we create links between entities in I2I base, I mean, that is based on investigation and belief that there is a link there, and then that gets explored, and if the link is accurate, then it is maintained, and if it's not, it'll be decoupled.",police
"So there's a whole host of investigative processes that go along with this, and to the question about integrating information from other jurisdictions, certainly we may be bringing information that other jurisdictions provide, and I know we think about this in terms of people entities, but keep in mind this also deals with, you know, locations, NIBIN, shell casing analysis, and there's a whole host of things that gets connected within this system. So this is not just about people and the civil liberties that track with it. It does have that, so that is certainly a component.",police
"So my concern here is, you know, whether this becomes an audit of the investigation writ large or whether we are trying to audit the use of this technology in investigations. Yes, I see that. Thank you, Chair Nelson, and thank you, Mr. Maxey, for that clarification.",police
"From our regular meetings with investigations and talking about investigations, I don't think that's the intent to audit your investigations department, rather that how this technology is being used, the capabilities of it, and ensuring that it is protecting civil liberties, and I do see this as, with this third-party accountability, as also protecting SPD from any unwarranted criticisms or daylighting, you know, vulnerabilities that we need to work to protect. Thank you. Lisa, did you want to say anything?",police
"Council Member Strauss? Chair Nelson and Brian, definitely feel free to jump in here. With due respect, I do think that this amendment specifies that we are looking at the IBM I-2 BASELINK analysis software.",police
I don't see in this amendment that we're requesting an audit of investigations. I think that this is well written as it stands. I don't necessarily see us needing to change it.,police
"I think that our conversation may have taken us in different tangents and directions because we're having a larger conversation than what's written on a piece of paper. Brian? Very specifically, the language that I'm squinting at here is the line that says the accuracy of linkages identified by users of IBM I-2 I-BASE software.",police
"That's the line that in my mind reads we need to test and validate whether they got the legitimacy or the accuracy of that link was supported by the investigative findings. That's where in my mind it digs deeper. Thank you, Chair.",police
"I don't necessarily see if we need to have a conversation with the third-party consultants so that we're focused on the software. I do think that the removing the accuracy of the data manually input, if the majority of data is manually input, then we're not. We've just cut out a majority of the information.",police
"I'm not necessarily trying to analyze how that information is identified previously before being input, but once it is input, I want to make sure that the data is correct. I think that honestly for SPD, this is another way to demonstrate from a third party that your criticisms are unfounded for this. This is a balanced amendment that provides SPD, a third-party consultant, a third-party validation of your work, and it also ensures that civil liberties aren't being compromised.",police
"A little slow on the draw here. Very appreciated, Madam Chair. I would like to move Amendment 1 that, in short, requests that the police department provide a report to the clerk that includes their data and records retention policies.",police
"Thank you very much. And with that, I move Amendment 3 listed on the agenda, and that is the request for the policies and procedures preventing employee access to the IMV, I-2, I-based link analysis software records. Second.",police
"I move Amendment 4 is listed on the agenda requiring the Police Department to provide to the clerk the notification on what the metrics are that they use provided to the Chief Technology Officer for the annual equity assessments that they already do for the IMV, I-2, I-based link analysis software. Second. All right.",police
"Good afternoon, everyone. There are two items on the agenda for full council tomorrow from the Economic Development, Technology and City Light Committee. And they are Council Bill 120307, which would authorize approval of the Surveillance Impact Report of SPD's Continued Use of Audio Recording Systems.",police
"And Council Bill 120309 would do the same for SPD's Continued Use of IBM i2iBase, which is a link analysis software program. Both pieces of legislation were amended in the committee and passed unanimously out of committee. And they'll be voted on tomorrow, as noted by our Council President.",police
My comments are regarding both SPD surveillance technologies. The city is not engaged in honest dialogue with the public on these surveillance technologies. The vast majority of the public's questions are still unanswered.,police
"This is largely due to SPD not answering questions by saying we have to get back to you on that, but then never doing so. This implies either that SPD doesn't understand the tools or is willfully hiding information. Regardless, the result is the same.",police
"Neither an incompetent nor a malicious city department like SPD should be trusted to operate surveillance technologies. Given the lack of honest commitment to the surveillance ordinance process, neither of these two technologies should be approved by city council. Council members should require that the public comment period deadline for any surveillance technology automatically extends until at least one week after all the public's questions have been answered, either on the Seattle IT privacy department or SPD's website.",police
"SPD is dodging one of the key purposes of surveillance ordinance, which is to provide transparency and accountability. In order to address this problem, the public comment period should be tied to SPD providing answers to the public's questions as an official deliverable instead of tying the public comment period purely to a calendar date. This is critically important given that group 4B surveillance technologies are currently going through their public comment period and thus far SPD's behavior hasn't changed.",police
"So it's up to council members to ensure the process doesn't continue while leaving community members' questions unaccounted for. Lastly, I've emailed you ways to fix the three amendments that were tabled in committee so as to address both the feedback from SPD and still meet the needs and intent from community members. I've also emailed you precise recommendations to add safeguards spanning security, bystander protections, data sources, tool functionality, contractual auditing, scoping, transparency, data sharing, validation, and privacy.",police
"It's the responsibility of city council to heed the concerns from the public and add official guardrails. As such, please see my emails to you for detailed recommendations you should take on these surveillance technologies. Thank you.",police
"Hello. My name is Jennifer Lee of the ACLU of Washington, and I am a member of the community surveillance working group commenting on agenda items CB120307 and 309 regarding SPD's use of audio recording systems and IBM i2i base. For SPD's use of audio recording systems, we appreciate the amendment passed that would require the disclosure of the manufacturer.",police
"However, we are still very concerned that the SIR does not specify the model names and numbers of the audio recording devices, which limits the ability of the public as well as council members to meaningfully review and approve this technology. Without public disclosure of the manufacturer's model names and numbers of the audio recording devices, it's impossible for there to be meaningful review as a purpose of the Seattle Surveillance Ordinance is to create transparency and accountability around the use of these technologies. SPD should also be required to disclose for how many incidents per year they use audio recording systems.",police
"On SPD's use of IBM i2i base, we are concerned that the city's contract with IBM has not been publicly disclosed as is required by the Surveillance Ordinance. I2i base's automated relationship analyses are likely to generate data errors that compound existing biases. While SPD has confirmed that false connections do occur, they have not shared how often they occur.",police
"There are no limits on the kinds of data that may be inputted into i2i base, no limitations on employee access to records, no limits on usage of potentially erroneous i2i base data, and no prohibition on the use of this technology for predictive policing. We ask that you require that SPD or the city make the contract with IBM publicly available, that SPD limit the kind of data that may be inputted both manually and automatically into i2i base, that the long data retention period is shortened, and the number of times that i2i base is used per year is disclosed. And finally, that predictive policing is banned.",police
"The report of the Economic Development Technology and City Light Committee, Council Bill, agenda item one, Council Bill 120307, an ordinance relating to surveillance technology implementation, authorizing approval of uses and accepting the 2021 surveillance impact report and 2021 executive overview for the Seattle Police Department's use of audio recording systems. The committee recommends the bill pass as amended. Thank you, Madam Clerk.",police
Council Member Nelson. Yes. So the 2017 surveillance ordinance requires city departments to obtain advance council approval for the acquisition of surveillance technologies and to request retroactive approval if those technologies have already been in use when that bill was passed.,police
"So these bills refer to the letter, and they are two technologies that make up group 4A, and I will just introduce how they've been dealt with in my committee and then then also address each one in turn. So Council Bill 120307 would approve the Seattle Police Department's continued use of audio recording systems and accept the surveillance impact report and an executive overview for that technology. At our April 27th committee meeting, we had a joint presentation from the Seattle Information from the Department of Seattle Information Technology and the Seattle Police Department, and they went over what these audio recordings were used for, and we also had a presentation from central staff on some of the policy concerns or issues that were brought up in the public process.",police
"SPD had said that they were already working on that and had no objections. Another amendment was sort of what we refer to as a belt and suspender approach as it related to biometric technology. We all recognize that the addition of new surveillance technology would require a new SIR and council action, but this basically just sort of doubles down on that expectation and says that we require SPD to revise or conduct a new SIR before moving forward if it was intended to do so as it relates to using biometric technology.",police
"The third amendment does not go as far, I think, as we heard in public comment as the work group would like, but does require that SPD identify the manufacturers and vendors of the audio recording systems. And lastly, replicating an amendment that Council Member Peterson made sort of a staple in his committee as it relates to these surveillance technologies, there's an amendment that requires SPD to report on the equity assessment or on the metrics that they're using and to include it in their annual equity assessment, the identification of the equity metrics. Thank you.",police
"Yep. Sorry about that. Agenda item two, Council Bill 120309, an ordinance relating to surveillance technology implementation, authorizing approval of uses and accepting the 2021 surveillance impact report and 2021 executive overview for the Seattle Police Department's use of IBM i2 iBase, use of IBM i2 iBase.",police
Thank you very much. IBase is a link analysis software program that SPD uses in the course of their investigations. This bill was amended.,police
"Council Member Herbold. Thank you. Just flagging the amendments that passed out of committee per Council Member Nelson's prompt, we requested that SPD take a look at its retention policy that complies with the minimum retention period allowed by state and federal law but also defines a clear deletion oversight process.",police
"I think that's what he's working on. Well, I printed mine out, so I don't trust technology at all. Okay.",police
"Last but not least, we also had to take a look into the data elements that are needed in order for this information to be fully tracked. And so we had Lauren Atherly walk us through the Mark 43 platform in order for us to, as I said, see how all of this information is being tracked. What does Mark 43 mean?",police
"Mark 43 is our sort of our database that collects all of the information from the calls that are coming in from the dispatchers. And so it basically collects all of the information with regards to the call. So when the call is coming in, at what time is calling in, what patrol is attending to this call, whether any information is being collected with regards to use of force or what patrol officers are engaging into these calls.",police
"And so it basically collects all of this information. We were focusing specifically on any reports with regards to the missing person cases. And so Mark 43 as a whole, it's our record management systems, our RMS.",police
"And the goal is to see and do an analysis of our data to ensure that we are not misclassifying any individuals that go missing or are murdered that are within our database. And so specifically, we're focusing on the data that we have here within that SPD to determine whether there are any problems. And so that is definitely what we're hoping to do.",police
"That's a different use of this data, but we don't do that. We don't ask other small business owners for this kind of detailed information. For example, we don't ask all produce vendors to submit the kinds of vegetables they sell and the prices they charge just to identify food deserts across our city and prevent their spread.",police
"That's not, the data collectors don't make those decisions. They, the data collection process itself will be objective. So I'm not exactly clear what, what the concern is because there's nothing unusual about that.",police
Hi. Just a couple points of clarity. I won't speak to the legal risk piece.,police
The fact that you say data will be analyzed by an unspecified school group is unsettling. A professional policy organization is more experienced keeping private information safe and free of data leaks. Thank you for your time.,police
"Thank you very much. This amendment, colleagues, just adds a recital to state that the council intent with this is that this information would be public. As we know, anything we do is public and the data itself, as many have said, is already publicly available.",police
"So, this is all... And I want to emphasize, this is all data from HMIS. This is not our internal data.",police
"National research will show that in many cases, that standard is clear and convincing for cases that involve termination or suspension. That's a very high standard. It's much higher of a standard than preponderance of the evidence, which is a standard that is most likely or most often sought by accountability advocates.",police
"Third is this just deals with things that are in the bill of rights. That's a particular section of the agreement. It's limited to those things which are in the bill of rights, and that's things like we're not going to engage in intimidating conduct in terms of how we do investigations.",police
"Mr. Zimmerman, were you signed up for the public hearing? Yes, exactly. This is a technology problem.",police
You're not going to have this really. For the most part. Because you have never worked with O.H.,police

"However, the City Council reserves the right to modify these public comment periods at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or is unsuitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner in which we are able to conduct our necessary business. I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner. The public comment period for this meeting is normally up to 20 minutes, but based on the number of speakers we have signed up, I'm going to extend it to 30 minutes.",public
"And each speaker will be given 1 1⁄2 minutes to speak. So speakers, if you were, please be prepared to speak for 1 1⁄2 minutes, and that'll take us to the full 30 minutes that we've extended it to for the public comment period. I'll call on speakers two at a time in the order in which they're registered on the Council's website.",public
"If you have not yet registered to speak but would like to, you can sign up before the end of this public comment period by going to the Council's website, seattle.gov forward slash Council. The public comment link is also listed on today's agenda. Once I call a speaker's name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone, and an automatic prompt that you have been unmuted will be the speaker's cue that it is their turn to speak, and the speaker must press star six to begin speaking.",public
"Press star six to begin speaking. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item that you are addressing. As a reminder, public comment should relate to an item on today's agenda or to our committee's oversight responsibilities.",public
"It looks like nearly everybody's signed up to talk about item four on the agenda, the Seattle Transportation Plan. Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of the allotted time. Once you hear the chime, we ask that you begin to wrap up your public comment.",public
"If speakers do not end their comments at the end of their allotted time, the speaker's microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next speaker. Once you have completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line and if you plan to continue following this meeting, please do so via Seattle Channel or using the listening options listed on the agenda. The regular public comment period for this committee meeting is now open, and we will begin with the first speaker on the list.",public
"Bob Anderton, go ahead and press star 6. It's your turn. We can come back to Bob Anderton if Bob's not ready.",public
"Bob, press star 6 on your phone. Oh, finally. Can you hear me now?",public
"We have nine signed up today, Council President. Thank you. Colleagues, at this time, we will open the remote public comment period for items on the Seattle Council agenda introduction and referral calendar and the Council's work program.",public
"It remains the strong intent of the City Council to have remote public comment regularly included on meeting agendas. However, as a reminder, the City Council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or is no longer suitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and effectively. So I did offer some words last time I heard from a few of my colleagues.",public
"I'm asking that those folks that are signed up that you speak to the City Council agenda, the introduction referral calendar and the Council's work program. And this basically asking you to be respectful and kind and just to get your words and your thoughts across so we can actually listen to you and do something about it. So with that, Madam Clerk, you can go ahead and start with the speakers if you want to start calling them three at a time.",public
"Okay, great. Thank you. The public comment period for this meeting is up to 20 minutes and each speaker will be given two minutes to speak.",public
Speakers are called upon in the order in which they registered to provide public comment on the Council's website. Each speaker must call in from the phone number provided when registered and use the ID and passcode that was emailed upon confirmation. Please note this is different from the general meeting listen line ID listed on the agenda.,public
If you did not receive an email confirmation please check your spam or junk mail folders. Once a speaker's name is called staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and automatic prompt of you have been unmuted Will be the speaker's cue that is their turn to speak and then the speaker must press star six to begin speaking.,public
Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item that you are addressing. Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of the allotted time. Once you hear the chime we ask that you begin to wrap up your public comment.,public
"If speakers do not end their comments at the end of the allotted time provided, the speaker's microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next speaker. Once you have completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line. And if you plan to continue following this meeting please do so via Seattle channel, or the listening options listed on the agenda.",public
"The public comment period is now open, and we'll begin by calling on the first speaker. Please remember to press star six after you hear the prompt of you have been unmuted. And our first speaker is Howard Gale.",public
"And for anybody who does want to provide us with public comment, of course, you can reach us at council at Seattle.gov on any topic related to the finance and housing committee. And for that matter, any topic related to city business. We will go ahead and skip public comment then and encourage folks to send in any comments that they may have related to items on our agenda or work plan.",public
"So hopefully we can get through all of those items of business. Before those items of business, we do, of course, have public comment. I believe that the public comment period is penciled in for 20 minutes, but I believe we only have two public commenters.",public
"So it'll probably go faster than that. Just as a reminder, when you hear your name called for those who are signed up for public comment, you will hear a prompt if you've been unmuted. That will be your cue to begin with your public testimony.",public
"So we will go ahead and recognize each speaker for two minutes, and, Mr. Clerk, if you would please moderate the public comment period and call those speakers, that would be great, and then we will proceed with the rest of our agenda this afternoon. So go ahead, please. The first person signed up for public comment today is David Haynes.",public
"Our next public commenter is Damon Tennell. Damon, we'll begin whenever you're ready. Damon, you may need to press mute.",public
"We'll get to that item and give you an opportunity to speak when we get to that item on the agenda. So at this time, we will turn to public comment, the remote public comment, and let me read some of the instructions, and then I'll hand it over to our clerk, Sarah Mays. It remains the strong intent of the Seattle City Council to have public comment regularly included on meeting agendas.",public
"I will read out the names. When I call your name, you will be prompted to unmute your self. When you hear that, please hit star six on your phone to unmute yourself and begin.",public
"When the minute is up, the microphone will be turned off. In recent meetings, the committee chair and panel speakers have said derogatory misleading things about small housing providers who made authentic public comments, calling us corporate fig leaves, referring to publicly confirmed issues as false narratives and declaring that small landlords are clearly unfamiliar with how the eviction moratorium works. Snide and civil commentary should not be allowed during council proceedings.",public
Since you appear to be muted if you hit star six you'll unmute. Sorry about that. I'm a small mom-and-pop landlord who rents to people in Seattle who work in a variety of lower-wage jobs.,public
"Do we have Laurence here? Laurence, you are still muted. If you get star six on your phone, you should unmute yourself.",public
"Nora, you are showing as still muted. If you can hit star six, you should unmute yourself. Still muted on your phone, so on your phone, star six.",public
I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner. Each speaker is given two minutes to speak. I'll call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they are registered on the website.,public
"If you have not yet registered, please do so. I'll call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they are registered. I'll call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they are registered.",public
"I'll call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they are registered. If you have not yet registered, you can sign up before the end of the public hearing by going to the Council's website. This link is also listed on today's agenda.",public
"Once I call a speaker's name, you'll hear a prompt. Once you've heard that prompt, you'll need to press star-6 to unmute yourself. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item which you are addressing.",public
"Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of the allotted time. And once the speaker hears that chime, we ask that you begin to wrap up your public comment. If speakers do not end their comments at the end of the allotted time provided, the speaker's mic will be muted after 10 seconds to allow us to hear from the next speaker.",public
"Once you've completed your public comment, please disconnect from the line if you plan to continue following this meeting. Please do so via the Seattle Channel or the listening options listed on the agenda. We've got three people in the queue signed up for public comment.",public
"Moving on to public comments. I will read the first set of instructions or directions and then Madam Clerk will take over. Colleagues, at this time we will open the remote public comment period for items on the city council agenda.",public
"Introduction and referral calendar. And the council's work program. As a reminder, the city council has the right to have remote public comment regularly included on meeting agendas.",public
"However, as a reminder, the city council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem the system as being abused or is no longer suitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and effectively. Madam Clerk, how many people do we have signed up? We have three signed up, Council President.",public
Thank you. So we have three speakers signed up. Two minutes each.,public

"No, Council Member Nelson, I'm sorry to interrupt, but the instructions are at this time we will open the remote public comment period for items on the agenda. And what is the general comment part to be able to speak? Is there a place to speak at a meeting in front of you for a general comment?",public
Again. So is that the general City Council meeting I can speak at a general comment or is this no comment other than your agenda? I am not a Council President and I'm not.,public
"At this time we will open the remote public hearing for item 2, council bill 120273. I will moderate the public hearing in the following manner. Each speaker will have up to two minutes to speak.",public

"Hi. Good morning. So this is a partial alley vacation for the block in downtown Seattle that's bounded by First and Second Avenues and Seneca and University Streets, just to the south of the Seattle Art Museum.",transport
"Of these first five, two are related to rapid ride lines, G and H on Madison and Delridge. And the other projects on the Alaskan way, main corridor, the center city streetcar connector project, and the Georgetown to South park trail. And the other four SDOT projects include the North lake retaining wall, the overlook walk and East West connections project, rapid ride for Roosevelt.",transport
"For Central, that would be through Meany and Washington. Through Southwest Pathway, through Denny School. To Southeast, that would be through Aki and through Mercer.",transport
"For Central Pathway and Southwest, that would be McClure and Madison. Northwest, that would be through Jane Adams and Robert Eagle Staff. At this time, there's only three high school pathways that we have left, and those are Roosevelt, Ballard, and Lincoln.",transport
In an of earthquake prone area. As sound transit is failed to build a vision systems to with the breakdown of the tunnel operations. Acting like they are saving us money.,transport
That you pay separately per 28 deep tunnel in West Seattle. And then two trains to go from West Seattle to downtown. Transferring in the industrial commercial zone south of the city.,transport
But they also demand that you get the one tunnel location in West Seattle and take two separate trains for before getting to downtown Seattle. As to justify the overpriced cost of public transportation. It is unacceptable that they will accept with everything that Trans partition wants.,transport
Especially when the people do not even take public transportation. And you waste extra time going into a deep tunnel. But there is plenty of money,transport
We will not provide the Cid any outreach. That there will be two tunnel ventilation facilities. Bad air from the fifth Avenue tunnel system for the next 100 years ago it is not acceptable.,transport
"However, the proposed route on Fifth Avenue South. It goes through the Ciba does the exact opposite. It is the route that inflicts maximum harm to three communities of color.",transport
"Chinatown, Japan town, and little Saigon. The fifth Avenue route will devastate economic, social and cultural cohesion. Destroy institutions weakened by Covid-19.",transport
"Into the proposed patient options like the Ballard station outside of neighborhoods. Even options that are mostly or entirely outside of the neighborhood boundary, altogether. Like the South Lake Union station option.",transport
"The Hawk corridor and some sidewalk expansion . as a component we wanted to go through as a reminder with those projects would look Likeand the finances with those projects. The East marginal corridor improvement project is a major freight corridor for an heavy haul route. As you can see, it is in three components, North, central, Southern . It is a vital route for oversized trucks.",transport
The project is located just right in the heart of a fellow. North of the Othello light rail station for we are on Mlk at the corner of the South willow Street and Martin Luther King. This project is a bit of a gateway . As you are going South on Mlk to the neighborhood.,transport
With segment by segment. This includes the Interbay and the South Interbay segment of Ballard. Here are just a couple of the examples or a few of the examples of the types of impact that would like to see.,transport
"The highest concerns that we want to see. At the minimized or mitigated for Deis, and includes navigation . and in vacation from elevated alternatives. This is relevant in the Elliott way corridor.",transport
The visual aesthetic impact related to an elevated Guideway. This would be true for any elevated Guideway throughout the system. Calling some particular systems around Elliott way for the residential and Business.Displacement.,transport
This is downtown. Some examples from downtown. For the downtown segment.,transport
It is in as a tunnel alignment alternative from Chinatown International district. Due South Interbay. Some of the impacts and issues that we would like to see fully mitigated the.,transport
"They were related to the construction impacts of the tunnel alternatives. Especially West Lake Avenue program the types of impact that would be city bus diversion from closed streets. The I-5 ramp . and beyond transportation, impact to garbage, recycling and emergency services to those areas during construction.",transport
Including anything that would have closures or replacement. Such as the South bridge and the Chinatown International district station. And impact to cultural resources and sites.,transport
"Especially Maritime businesses. They will be impacted by the water crossing. And also to traffic, transit, residence.",transport
It includes a South Interbay segment for the North portal and the downtown tunnel. In two of the three alternatives. This comes out at a Republican and a go across Elliott way to we would like to see additional mitigation for the impact for the construction and the operation of that elevated area.,transport
With this it would like to see additional information to support a full understanding in comparison to the alternatives is the Chinatown International district. For this is the fifth Avenue in the alternatives. We would like to see avoidance or mitigation for transportation impact.,transport
"Associate with the road closure . and the replacement of the fourth Avenue bridge structure. For 2A, this is the fifth Avenue shallow and deep alternatives for we would like to see avoidance, mitigation for the business impact associated with those alternative options. And for all of the alternatives.",transport
To avoid some of the impacts associated with Denny West Lake. Or to find a way to ensure the optimal transit at South Lake and Harrison. Cid we seek additional analysis as we mentioned earlier on the impact and mitigation.,transport
And my two questions. On slide number 17. You Referenced the Cid station and Sodo.,transport
When we are Referencing that. In terms of the bridge structure. Is the fourth Avenue bridge shallow option.,transport
The station construction requires the fourth Avenue Viaduct structure . It is basically a bridge Structur for that the fourth Avenue is on. As the segment passes Union station to Jackson. That is part of what I think Sarah was describing.,transport
"This is just a reminder of the topics. This would also help with the transition. You have station options, and the prospect Street area where you see that, or North at Gator street.",transport
"As you can see, there are various alignment configurations on eighth Avenue, the tracks, 15th Avenue, or Transitioning to 15th to the tracks area along armory way. Next slide. Downtown, in pink, the preferred alternative on fifth and Harrison, and the other alternative is six and Mercer.",transport
You see station locations as well. All of these are tunneled stations. Next slide.,transport
"Chinatown I.D. Come alternatives on fourth and the vicinity of Fifth, fourth alternative and shallow, fifth deep and fifth shallow, and a fifth shallow diagonal station configuration that would have the same interest location on fifth but a slightly different configuration for getting to the station. Next slide, please.",transport
"We have on the left, and alignment with the station adjacent to the existing station and a staggered configuration similar to the North. The South station often where the new and existing station would push a little bit further South towards Lander and a mixed profile alternative where the new station and Guideway would be elevated rather than at greater. With these alternatives, they assume, the first three cases, Overpasses Outlander.",transport
"In the mixed profile, only one. Next slide, please. In Duwamish, three alternatives, preferred is the South crossing, immediately's--below that, a South edge crossing alignment option, similar, the process, harbour Island farther South.",transport
"In a North crossing alternative on the North side of the existing bridge. Next slide Finally, West Seattle and Delridge. In the junction, elevated alternatives in pink, we also have come in Brown, tunnel 41St and 42Nd options.",transport
"In blue, a short tunnel 41St option and a medium tunnel 41St option. To the right of this, in Delridge, we have three station locations potentially, and over, the Dakota, and on Delridge way with the alignment options going along and over or along Delridge way and Genesee. Next slide that was background, information you have seen before I will switch gears and talk about information that is not in the draft but is something that we have been Cherry publicly through this comment period.",transport
"These ideas are not in the draft, they are based on limited work and would need further assessment before being adopted as part of the project and additional public feedback. Next slide. Focusing on the first category, next slide, these are the five ideas across the core door for cost savings, number one is to shift the station which could result in a savings of $200 million.",transport
The station entrance refinements in downtown which could achieve a cost savings of 206 $5 million. I will explain these and details and subsequent slides number five is to ship the slightly which could result in a savings of 100 $20 million. Starting in the junction with the first idea of shifting the elevated station.,transport
"The light in red shows what is in the draft, the light in green shows the potential refinements which would shift that station and the alignment associated with it a little bit to the East, by doing so it would avoid a multi family development with 300 fewer Displacements and could result in a cost savings of about $200 million. Next slide. The second idea is eliminating the Avalon station.",transport
"Again, you can see the Red line showing what is in the draft. This would eliminate the Avalon station and allow our lower height Guideway and Delridge station and avoids, if you combine it with the previous idea it would avoid the multi family development in the junction and have a similar overall Ridership which is shown in the purple bar chart. If you did both of the ideas together, you would have a cost savings of about $325 million.",transport
"This shows eliminating the Avalon station with the medium tunnel 41St alternative, a tunnel alternative that has been 30 in the draft. If you eliminated the Avalon so soon station you can reduce property effects on Displacements and have similar overall Ridership and it could result in a cost savings of about $60 million compared to what is in the financial plan. Next slide.",transport
"In the downtown segments, the third idea is to consolidate the Denny and South Lake Union stations. In red, the alternative, included in the draft which you can see, the yellow Rectangles represent the station locations at Denny and South Lake Union included in the draft. The green line represents the consolidated station locations that would be in the vicinity of Dexter and Denny with lower Ridership and avoid impacts to the streetcar and could connect to either the Seattle center station options.",transport
"On the right, it would reduce the Ridership by about 10,000. It would result in a cost savings of about $575 million. This is just a close-up of that particular station location.",transport
"The gray rectangle in the middle shows the platform location underneath Dexter Avenue and also shows how it can preserve North, South, East, West transit opportunities. Next slide. The fourth idea is potential station entrance refinements, there are several.",transport
"The first is at the Midtown station as you can see, the idea is that we would shift the entrance from private property into the sidewalk. Right now, many of our station Entrances are soon to be on private property, property in downtown, as you can imagine, very expensive and in some cases, if it is a possible to avoid that, move the Entrances into the existing public Right- Of-Way and we could yield some cost savings. In this location, fourth and Madison, associated with the North Midtown station entrance, it could have a cost savings of about $20 million.",transport
"Another station entrance refinements is in the West Lake station. Right now in the draft we have assumed three station Entrances to the new stations in addition to the Entrances to the existing station. If we eliminated two Entrances and consolidated them into a larger single entrance, with a single head house with multiple entry points, we could eliminate some of the property acquisition costs and have a cost savings potentially of $190 million.",transport
"The third idea in the downtown area is in the Denny station area where, if we can avoid some property acquisition and instead move the entrance into the street, we could have a cost savings of about $55 million. This would require the permanent foreclosure of Lenore street to accommodate this. Next slide.",transport
"The last segment is in the Ballard section, the idea is to shift the tunnel 14th Avenue alignment. Here you see, in red, the alternative alignment that is leading the draft, the tunnel alternative on 14th. If we shifted that out of the roadway we could result of cost savings of $140 million.",transport
"The next slide shows that in closer detail where you can see the alternative in the middle of the public Right-Of-Way. If we shifted that out of the roadway, and eliminated the station entrance on the West side of 14th, the total cost savings would be about 100 million dollars. Those are the cost savings ideas and we have looked at other refinements that could address other risks.",transport
"There are six ideas, starting on the left. First, providing access North and south of Andover street. I will go over ideas about how to improve Andover street.",transport
"This is another entrance refinement in the Midtown station area. Item C is shifting the Seattle center West. Item D involves connecting the South Lake Union and Harrison alternative, the pink line, to the Seattle center at Mercer alternative, mixing and matching the two alignments in this location.",transport
"And shifting the tunnel portal is item E, further South to avoid impacts in that area. Item f is consolidating the Smith Cove and Interbay stations. Starting in Delridge, I will go over these, this provides better access on the North--the South side of Andover Street associated with the Andover Street patient location.",transport
"A couple of ideas for doing this, one idea is to provide a pedestrian bridge across Andover Street so people do not have to cross the street in the location. If we could have a pedestrian bridge at that location, it would improve the experience of getting to the station platform. Next slide.",transport
Another idea is to shift the station itself slightly to the South. You can see the two yellow Rectangles at the top right of the graphic. The new station location would overlap the existing proposed station location.,transport
"By doing that, it facilitates access on the South side of Andover Street and facilitates a lower height of station and Guideway. It would require the closure or Reroute of 32nd Avenue Southwest as noted on the bottom left of this graphic. Next slide.",transport
"In the downtown segments, the item be is a Midtown station refinement. Again, this is trying to reduce property acquisition. This is at the Midtown station, the South entrance at the corner of fifth and Columbia.",transport
"That is a complicated property acquisition and a complicated entrance to build and if we can shift it out of the private property onto the street Right- Of-Way and put the entrance in the sidewalk, it could reduce some risk. Item C is shifting the station to the West. This is associated with the preferred alternative.",transport
"As you can see, in green, represents the shifted station location, basically moving the station a block or two to the West to avoid concerns with the impact and the proximity to the Seattle center. Next slide. Item D is connecting the South Lake Union station, pink South Lake Union station with the blue Mercer station location.",transport
"Essentially, what is represented in green is a Mix- And-Match between the alignments in the station location to address some concerns and impacts in that area. Next slide. South Interbay, again, this idea involves looking at the tunnel portal and shifting that tunnel portal for those purposes, South.",transport
That portal location is currently in the draft and will be adjacent to the station on prospect street. We have been moving that portal a little bit further South. The benefit of this is it would help reduce some slope stability concerns that we had in that area.,transport
"You can see that this would require the station Locationhe moved north of the magnolia bridge, as represented by the green rectangle, currently the station options are to the South. By shifting that tunnel portal South, you can see that it would lessen the slope--steep slope of Fax, but as represented by the yellow rectangle, it requires shifting the station further North. Next slide.",transport
"The final idea is to consolidate the Smith Cove and Interbay stations. You can see where the text is for Smith Cove, the currently proposed station, where it would be, to the right is the Interbay station location. This would be looking at consolidating both those locations into a midpoint location represented by the green line.",transport
"You can see the green rectangle, which would be north of the magnolia bridge, adjacent to the Seattle armory property. The alignment would be essentially in tunnel until you get to the green station location which would be a retained cut station and would continue and tunnel to Ballard which could connect to the 14th or 15th tunnel locations in Ballard. This shows more detail on that.",transport
The blue identifies some of the benefits or opportunities associated with this alternative. It would avoid impacts to the parks and green belts along that section of Elliott Avenue between hillside and avoid steep slope concerns in that area. It would avoid traffic effects on Elliott because we would be in tunnel until we get north of the magnolia bridge.,transport
"There would be a minor reduction in the overall Ridership and that is represented by the green bar chart on the right which reduces overall Ridership by about 2000. It does avoid a former landfill, the golf center is on the landfill, it would avoid Impacting that area. It also avoids railroad and Interbay properties in the vicinity of the Interbay station.",transport
"As noted, it identifies potential and existing connections to Expedia, represented by the green dotted lines in this area and shows the potential connections to the Greenbrier trails. It would directly serve the armory site and areas that have development potential. It would have potential connections to the trail network and Interbay.",transport
"I just want to highlight the fact that I have heard a lot of different perspectives about the Avalon station. I appreciate that some emphasize the development on and around Avalon needs--it is important to keep the station, others are okay with removing it. I hear from those who are okay with removing it, some unified belief that we should only do so if it provides some benefit to the West Seattle community, such as a longer tunnel.",transport
"I also want to highlight that, as it relates to Accessing the line via Delridge, the high point community and others would be most likely to access the line via 35th and the Avalon station. If there was a consideration to remove the Avalon station, we would need to have a clear plan for providing access from high point and the adjacent communities. And, just an old point that I have made before in a letter I submitted.",transport
"I want to take the opportunity to state for the record that an elevated alignment through the heart of the West Seattle junction urban village and through a built neighborhood in the Youngstown area of North Delridge would be, not only unique to this line, but unprecedented for light rail in Seattle. That is why so many people have concerns about the proposal. As far as the questions go, I did have a question about the Guideway height for the option in Dell ridge with the elevated Fauntleroy station and lower Guideway for the Delridge station.",transport
"I would be interested to know, at the highest point, how high the Guideway would be? Also, I am trying to understand the assumptions around removing the Avalon station. The presentation says that it will be the same number of riders whether there is an Avalon station or not, but says there are 1200 riders that would be using the Avalon station.",transport
"How did you determine the number of riders? There are a lot of multi family buildings on Avalon, how do you make that determination of likely Ridership? We have covered this before but it would help to refresh my memory, particularly in taking about how you approach that question in light of a particular community that, even though there is the golf course, this is a very Built- up, dense part of the line and I am not sure what the assumptions are, perhaps there are assumptions that people will continue using rapid ride, but I would like to hear more about that.",transport
"In regards to the first question, the Guideway height, with regard to the elevated Fauntleroy alternative which assumes an alignment along Genesee through Delridge . at its highest point, which is the lowest point in Delridge as a ghost through the Longfellow Creek. The preferred alternative Guideway height is about 150 feet. Less at the station locations.",transport
"At its highest point, where it is crossing the lowest point in the valley, the Guideway is about 100 50 feet high, and it needs to be to get up to the height of the Avalon station. If you do not have the Avalon station, you don't necessarily have to have as high of a Guideway, you can reduce that to 30 feet through the Delridge area . that would be the implication as I noted briefly in the presentation. In regards to the Avalon station and removing it, and the Ridership implications, that is one of the lower Ridership stations on the line.",transport
"It has about 1200 people riding according to our productions. If we remove the Avalon station from consideration, we think the bus routes that would be integrated with the station would integrate with the Alaska junction station, have to Ridership on Avalon is bus transfers and those buses, instead of transferring--the riders, we would assume they would just transfer to the Alaska junction, or Delridge, but primarily Alaska junction. That is why the Ridership does not change, the bus Ridership would be going to another station instead.",transport
"The other part of the equation is the Avalon station is close to the walk shade, which is similar, about a third of a mile in separation between the stations. That is part of the reason people would walk to the other station location instead. That is based on our Ridership projections.",transport
"With slide, I may be speaking out of my district come out of my turn, I just want to look at this and I will end with a question. Having an Inter-Base station, this consolidation, it seems like it is being placed on 15th. If that is correct, I just have to raise that this ignores the community concerns about placing a station on 15th that was--all of these comments will come to you from the time we had the elected leadership group, that we had the Dias framework narrowed in so you could do this work.",transport
"Because there was a very strong push to say West the 15th is best and now I am concerned that this is now putting it back on 15th. I know that we have had a fair amount of work with Ballard, the original corridor, and a letter presented to Psrc about getting Federal funding for the corridor, we have a very narrow right away with increased use, and I know a letter was signed to Psrc and we were successful in getting the amendment and we would love to have your participation in the Workgroup moving forward. I just want to highlight it feels like this is a ignoring and making assumptions about development decisions not yet made about the armory.",transport
"Thank you for the question. I can better explain this particular alternative that I think will address your concerns. This alternative, as you noted, is adjacent to 15th, not on 15th, it would be to the West of 15th.",transport
"I would also note that the alignment is primarily underground. It would not have traffic affects on 15th. The alignment, if you look at the graphic here, you can see where the yellow rectangle is.",transport
"That is where the station could potentially be. It would not be within the 15th Right-Of-Way, it would be in the property to the West of that the brackets to the left--to the right, show the area where there would be a retained cut, low-grade and open to the top, with opportunities to cross over on crossings in those locations. Everything to the North and south of the black brackets would be in tunnel, below grade.",transport
"Again, there would be no direct effects to the 15th Avenue Right-Of-Way. As you noted, from phase one, the elected leadership group process and the community process director, there was concerns about impacts to traffic. Again, as I noted in my slides, hopefully I noted in my slides, this alignment could connect to either the 14th or 15th tunnel locations in Ballard it could go either direction.",transport
"That is one of the concerns. In terms of the concerns about industrial lands, yes, I recognize that this is just noting the potential regarding the armory property which could serve the station location but does not assume that in the Ridership estimates, no change in land use is assumed as part of the alternative so that daily trips on the project is based on existing Land-Use assumptions, not assuming any element of the property necessarily. To the last question, yes, this alternative was not looked at in phase 1, and was not looked at in the draft Deis in phase 2 . This is a new idea it is in response, or based on following the board direction to look at opportunities to find cost savings.",transport
"Although, in this case, not so much a cost savings that would result from this alternative, but it avoids a lot of potential risk areas as noted on this graphic. There were impacts to parks in the Greenbelt associated with the draft Deis alternatives that this would potentially avoid and addresses concerns about steep slopes which could have cost applications. It avoids traffic affects on Elliott which are noted in the draft Deis you would not have those traffic affects.",transport
"With the Bracketed--you answer the question about the supplemental Deis . about the 15th impact, you answer long- term questions about the Right- Of-Way, and were Spot-On that the tunnel will limit the impacts to the Right-Of-Way. My concern is, did I hear you say that the Bracketed area here would be a cut and cover--or, in the street? It would not be in the street, it would be on a property to the West of the right away.",transport
"It would be a retained cut. The station itself would be open to the outside, much like the Chinatown Id station and we could have roadway Overpasses to provide access to the properties to the West, there are a couple of locations right now where you can access those properties and that was to be a possibility. Maybe we are having a nomenclature issue.",transport
"Seeing the brackets starting on Interbay golf on the right, just in the letter C in consolidated Smith Cove. That is the area that would be open? Correct.",transport
"If we can move to slide 49. I will just start with sharing with the sound transit team, directed at no one in particular, just that, because of the pedestrian safety and Connectivity to the downtown commercial and residential core, I do not see an option east of 15th as being acceptable. I think it is a question I need to have answered here.",transport
"I highlight the fact that, right now, the core residential area in Ballard is to the West of 15th . There is residential north of market street. However, there is not residential south of market street. If we are looking about moving people because that is what the sound transit is all about, I have very great concerns that, either people would have to cross market Street if--for assuredly, they would have to E cross 15th.",transport
"Again, we bring up the industrial conversation because, with 15th and market, they are the two borders of the industrial area, that are again, we are having the industrial conversation again, I am not seeing a proposal to change this area. Yes, it could happen in the next 15, 16 years, but I see us having more needs for our industrial area and not fewer. I think that your graphic really demonstrates the industrial nature of this area--when you look at Northwest 45Th street, there are two Crescent-Shaped lines on the diagram, these are former railroad lines that are either partially or not in use at this time.",transport
Those rail lines continued all the way to market Street and all the way up 14th because that was the former bridge street. I see a desire to use that Right-Of-Way. Now we are talking about moving even further East away from the core.,transport
"We would need to be looking at that 15th Avenue crossing in context of the 14th Avenue station alternative, we would need to look at the 15th Avenue crossing and ways to make it a safer crossing for pedestrians, if the station weren't 14th. In the case, the 15th Avenue station alternative and the elevated alternatives, they do envision the entrance on the West side of 15th. You would not have that crossing concern with those particular alternatives.",transport
"That is right. I think that we all know that the people will use or choose not to use transit infrastructure, bicycle infrastructure, walking infrastructure, of low stress levels if they are a low stress level user, they will not use two separate pieces of low stress infrastructure if it is crossed and divided by a high stress environment. That is what 15th is, that is what market Street is.",transport
"To be able to to have a station placement that is divided from the core of Ballard by 15th, it will not just be station area improvements are needed, it will need to be a way that everyone feels very safe about crossing the street. Again, my concerns I raised in my last--in the last slide we discussed and the concern I raise here, is that 15th Avenue is the third most used North- South corridor after Sr-9 and I- 5. it is responsible for our disaster mitigation. I share this with you because there is a need to create the pedestrian Connectivity and ensure the goods of freight and truck movement are able to move freely through this area.",transport
"We did, as you know, as you recall, in the phase 1 of the Stakeholder advisory group process, we did look at station locations to the West of 15th, but, as part of the initial phase of project development, we did look at options to the West of 15th. As you recall, a lot of the alternatives went through the screening process, that included review and recommendations by the Stakeholder advisory group and the leadership group. Those ideas were not carried forward.",transport
"This was presented to the elected leadership group and community members were quite loud I know this because I was staffing it, I was there, I heard both elected leaders and community advocates asking for this. One of the screening criteria that it was my recollection was used, you wanted to go forward with your number options to be able to base cost and feasibility and two of those options, it is basically 15th and 14th, with elevated versus tunnel. At that point, you did not know if the tunnel would be more expensive than the elevated structure we now know the elevated structure is more expensive, which is why we're only left with two options.",transport
"My concern is that, one of the reasons that 20th, 17th, even 22nd were screened out, was because of the cost, because the tunnel was assumed to be more expensive than the bridge. Absolutely, a bridge, an aboveground structure landing in the core of Ballard would be highly disruptive and highly costly. Now that I see you are leaning us towards having a tunnel in this area, in our last--the last time you came to Committee, I asked about what determines the cost of a tunnel, geology, direction?",transport
"These are the things that have been brought up. We don't need to answer it now but I raise this because we were told that we could not have--the community brought you four options and we were told two options were not going to work because of cost, because we were basing our decisions off of the bridge, the bridge is now the Premier option for us. So, when we do apples to apples comparisons of Connectivity to the core of Ballard, across 15th on a surface level, as compared to the cost of turning a drill ever so slightly just a few Millimeters to hit a different angle, what is going on?",transport
"In terms of the alternatives that were looked at in the previous phase in 2017, the 2019 Timeframe, you are correct, we looked at options further West. You are correct in that the expectations about tunnel costs have changed compared to elevated costs. As has been noted because of increased real estate cost and construction costs and our needs we have identified as part of project development.",transport
It is important to note that it was not just cost that was a determining factor in screening out those alternatives further West. There were technical feasibility concerns in terms of getting there. They dealt with infrastructure that we need to avoid the Emerson interchange.,transport
"And some other underground utilities in that area. That was also a factor in assessing, or screening out, those alternatives, some of the alternatives further West. There were also concerns with residential affects.",transport
"Some of the street Right-Of-Way further West is narrower and much more built up. Therefore, fitting in a station within that more dense urban area would have required large residential Displacements. Not that that cannot be done but that was a factor in ruling out those alternatives.",transport
"It is true to say that the costs--to explain or other concern, it is true to say that the cost of elevated and tunnel alternatives have gotten closer in this case. The tunnel 14th is similar to the elevated in this area and there has been a convergence between tunnel and elevated costs. The relative cost of tunnels to each other would still hold and the total alternatives further West are more expensive at that time because they were longer tunnels.",transport
"Again, that would involve tunnel stations in more Built- up areas. That was part of the cost element. That was not the only factor.",transport
"As I said, technical feasibility and residential affects were important factors at that time in terms of just cost, the length of the tunnels and the location of the stations would have factored into those cost differentials as well. Again, this is probably a much deeper conversation if you would like to discuss further, I would be happy to. That is why I'm going to read your book and why I love working with you.",transport
"I highlight that you say, at the time, there would be longer tunnels required. I know the tunnel portal was of great concern to get to 17th through 20th. I just highlight slide 70 where we were talking about--you don't have to move, just when we were talking about Interbay, we were talking about moving the tunnel Portals completely, with that new information, it seems like there may be more information to be investigated in this area as well.",transport
"That might relief the cost of longer tunnels. It may also believe the technical barrier of the underground utilities, Infrastructur, and I will say this, there is no easy way of saying this, but to, on one hand, say we cannot have a station in--West of 15th because of residential displacement, and then request to build a station where there is not land use code allowing residential buildings, it gives me a lot of pause. It gives me a lot of concern.",transport
"Again, I have great concerns regarding any station placement east of 15th, I have a strong desire to deliver infrastructure consistent with what voters approved, and I appreciate you and am incredibly impressed with this presentation. No further questions, chair. That is all I have.",transport
"I mostly want to make comments but I am happy to get direct feedback and clarify things. I first want to start by saying that I have gotten very strong community feedback, universally, for Sib 1 alignment in South Interbay. I want to go on the record and Express that that location and alignment was served the residents of South magnolia, West queen and, the needs of port of Seattle, and service the cruise ship terminal.",transport
"It is a very big added benefit that it protects the city asset of the Greenbelt and reduces the amount of loss that alternative alignments do not accommodate and I want to express that. As far as the preferred alignment, that is the stronger preference with community Stakeholders we have spoken to about it. For similar reasons, there has been consternation expressed about the consolidated station in Interbay.",transport
"While it seems to have equal access to a lot of other assets, it seems to be far away from those assets and not necessarily be best positioned to capitalize on transportation connections, particularly for folks who are making magnolia connection commutes. That Consolidated station is met with a lot of opposition from Stakeholders in queen Ann and magnolia who will be Commenting on the environmental impact statement and wanted to raise up those concerns. There has been concerns that the rider estimate may be underestimated on disproportionately Impacting magnolia connection rides.",transport
"The concept about moving the station further West down Republican to the spot that I believe is currently occupied by a fast food restaurant, can you comment now, or maybe I can check in with Kexp, does that mitigate their concerns about the potential impacts to do that station movement further down Republican? Or, does it only partially mitigate or not mitigate the potential impacts to the cluster and that corridor in Republican? My understanding is that the Mercer Street alignment is far preferable to avoid potential impacts to have to make mitigate any relocation or long- term closure of some of the institutions like the Seattle Rep, Kexp station.",transport
And so we're looking at building ramps and or a wheelchair stair climber. Next slide. The station space is at King Street Station.,transport
"So this is going to be a very strong site for youth programming. And it's in, I believe it's the third floor of sorry, the second floor of King Street Station. Next slide.",transport
As it is a critical connection pathway between the West and building facility. And the parking garage area. The pathway and the tunnel carries a majority of the utility and generator power for the building.,transport
"Systems within the building. Just wanted to let, let the council know that that tunnel is very critical to the development of the utility. And the parking garage area.",transport
So the 2001 six LLC utility tunnel provides a pathway for a major portion of the utility and generator power for the Westin building. Tenants from the parking garage. The West until building.,transport
One six. LLC to continue operating and maintaining a utility tunnel. Under the alley between fifth Avenue and sixth Avenue.,transport
So the one tunnel has been around for a long time. The second tunnel has been for around for a lot longer time. And as thought is recommending approval of this renewal as well.,transport
"It has vital importance to the health and safety of our community. Next slide, please. So here's pictures of the tunnels.",transport
"They're. Just functional operational tunnels. Use it can be used by the public, but they're primarily used by visitor staff.",transport
"A resolution granting conceptual approval to construct, a new lumber warehouse in the Wallingford neighborhood. District four, north of Northeast North lake way. As proposed by Dunn lumber company as part of the construction of a new lumber warehouse in the wallingford neighborhood.",transport
"The buildings with an underground fiber optic cable running under Latona Avenue, Northeast. We do have a presentation here. Calvin chow.",transport
"The construction of a new lumber warehouse in the wallingford neighborhood, which is located on the east side of the building and the underground fiber optic cable running under Latona Avenue Northeast. Next slide, please. So the communication with Con a conduit would connect the existing Dunn lumber office with the new warehouse facility.",transport
Across the street. To the right here. You see the proposed location.,transport
"So the conduit will carry private communications between the two facilities and it will connect the two facility operations in a way that it's not. It's not a. It's not a radio under Latona Avenue, Northeast.",transport
"It's just a small communication conduit that would run fiber optics between the two facilities. Next slide, please. Here's just some images.",transport
Conceptual approval for that conduit pipe. That would go underground across the street. It's not the project as a whole.,transport
Are there any comments to oppose this tunnel? Not seeing any. All right.,transport
Colleagues resolution 32053 grants conceptual approval to allow Dunn Lumber to install a communication pipe under Latona Avenue Northeast to connect its existing building in Wallingford to the new building it's constructing across the street. This resolution was recommended unanimously by our committee. Thank you.,transport
It's so important because 15th Avenue is the third most used North South corridor only behind SR 99. And I five. A lot of people.,transport
"This project will deliver on the promise to provide needed transportation infrastructure to a community that has accepted significant growth and the challenges that come along with it. Ballard is united in its desire for a tunnel alignment with a station located on Northwest Market Street at 15th Avenue Northwest. The station placed in this location will not only serve the abundance of residents and transit riders located in the central Ballard core, it will also help preserve our maritime and industrial lands for their intended use.",transport
"The draft resolution before you today is spot on. We fully support the resolution's assertion that station access be provided from the west side of 15th Avenue Northwest, as well as from both sides of Market Street. A station located at 15th is the only option that will ensure pedestrian safety",transport
"A 14th Avenue station would not only put pedestrians at risk with a long crossing of a major freight corridor, it will also completely miss the mark in serving the existing and ever-growing residential core in Ballard. Additionally, should the resolution include the recommendation for additional study on other segment areas, we would endorse additional study of alternative stations located west of 15th Avenue Northwest. Finally, I just wanted to commend the city of Seattle for the work that hired.",transport
"I just want to second Mike Stewart's comments on the location that the Mayor has picked for this resolution, and we think it's invaluable to have it under the Ship Canal and also a station, not a 14th, but a 15th. I also want to second the comments. In this resolution, if you're going to study other things, we would prefer that the station be located more west of 15th and downtown Seattle out of our industrial area, but also where it's more appropriate and where more riders would ride Sound Transit in the heart of the business district.",transport
"I'm with the T organization, Transit Equity for All, and I'm representing the CID, and our basic push is to have 4th Avenue or another option, and having 5th Avenue as a selection is very bad for the whole region, and this is a human cost issue, and if you folks go on 5th Avenue, it'll wipe out Chinatown, and there will not be any Chinatown. I really appreciate if you do the right human thing and choose 4th Avenue or another alternative. Thank you.",transport
"We find the 5th Avenue route unacceptable. Please remember, 134 years ago, the Chinese were forcibly removed from Seattle, and then 80 years ago, the Japanese-Americans suffered the same fate, and in 2022, we will not let history repeat itself in the CID. We are here to stay.",transport
"Sorry, I am speaking today in favor of the tunnel option into the West Seattle Junction. I am in favor of the south corridor over the Duwamish Waterway. But most importantly, I am here to speak about some not favorably speak, but speak to bad design.",transport
"Bad station design violates all the principles of training that many of the station areas entail. Station areas are placed in a node, so that there is a walkshed all the way around that node. I am very, very disappointed by the proposed alignment of the Delridge segment to be at the Andover slash Delridge location.",transport
"That is a very, very poor location for any potential transit-oriented development, which is desperately needed within this corridor. And the City of Seattle bears a huge responsibility to ensure that there is equitable transit-oriented development. Putting a station at the intersection of Andover and Delridge is a horrible mistake.",transport
"I'm here to speak on behalf of all the neighbors that we have been talking with across an array of different events and forums, in which we have found no support for the Delridge option that was mentioned by several previous callers. This is the option that is next to the steel mill. We find this location to be far away from the community it intends to serve.",transport
"It's next to the steel mill, so there's no opportunity to create any type of development to facilitate transportation and switching between buses and the train in that location. It also displaces different businesses that serve normally low-income communities. Our request is really to support, but to study and investigate other options like Del 1A for a full tunnel.",transport
"Go ahead, Kirstie and or Scott. Hello, thank you for allowing me to speak today. My name is Scott Stroop and I'm here to speak in opposition of the proposed recommendation of Del 6 in the Delridge station location.",transport
"In the CID, study shallow force and study it even shallower with a cut-and-cover at the same grade as the existing station to save big on cost, time, and disruption, and once again activate Grand Union Station train haul. Relocate South Lake Union Station, which is currently not inside the neighborhood boundary at all, and at Seattle Center, prefer Republican Street Station, studied one to two blocks west of Seattle Center to mitigate impacts to art organizations. And very finally, at Ballard, over...",transport
"And thank you for the opportunity to comment. I am in the west Seattle area commenting upon resolution 32055. And what I'd like to bring up is question one, why are we recommending a Delridge segment that's actually incompatible with the DEL 6?",transport
"The two routes don't run along the line. I am not in favor of DEL 6 because it actually puts my neighborhood at risk from an EIS situation. The other question I have is if DEL 6 is used, why does that take it so far to the walkshed that would actually serve people?",transport
I don't see how that supports the core values for equity and so on from the city. The Avalon station also creates a problem for the values two and three for providing safety and user experience from the neighborhood next to the west Seattle on ramp. The last thing here I will say is the 41st street option seems to be a good option to keep things low so it's not affecting the neighborhood.,transport
"And why can't that connect to the preferred option of the tunnel and of Genesee? Last thing, we're going to suffer huge multiple years of construction stuff right in our backyards from this project. Please mitigate.",transport
"And while I'll be the one that's kind of flying through these slides quickly, I will also be pausing occasionally and will encourage Marshall to intervene at any point to add additional context. So let's start with West Seattle segments. This includes in the DEIS alternatives, the segment for West Seattle Junction, for Delridge, and for the Duwamish water crossing.",transport
"Next slide. So starting with the West Seattle Junction segment, this includes the Alaska Junction Station and the Avalon Station. The recommendation from the City is for WSJ-5.",transport
That is the medium tunnel to Alaska Junction Station at 41st Street Southwest with a retained cut Avalon Station. Go ahead to the next slide. Thank you.,transport
"The rationale for this is from a safety and user experience standpoint to avoid the site line obstructions during operation. And so this image presents a rendering of what we're trying to avoid. This is an image of WSJ-1, which is one of the elevated alternatives that's in the DEIS that would create permanent site line obstructions that would impact safety for all roadway users.",transport
"In addition, from a rationale from a community standpoint, avoids the numerous impacts associated with an elevated guideway through an existing residential neighborhood, including noise, aesthetics, and again those safety considerations. And from a financial stewardship standpoint, the medium tunnel alternative offers the benefits of a tunnel alignment at a comparable cost of the other DEIS elevated alternatives. Go ahead to the next slide.",transport
"So again, this is a rendering of what we're trying to avoid. This is a picture that would show an elevated structure and the impacts associated with it. What we've heard from community is strong support for the tunnel.",transport
"We've heard about concerns for the impacts of an elevated guideway, including visual and noise during construction, development constraints due to the column safety due to the site line obstructions, as well as concerns about construction impacts and to operations and character of the business district. Go to the next slide. So moving to the Delridge segment, and we will take a little bit of extra time with this segment because it is one of our RET priority communities, as well as because there has been just a tremendous amount of community discussion and deliberation about the alternatives.",transport
The recommendation is for alternative Del 6. This is the elevated lower height Delridge station at Andover. One thing to note is that there are really three groupings of station alternatives in Delridge.,transport
"There is the Andover, and that's noted in the green dot that you see in the image. There are the Delridge Way alternatives, that's Del 3 and Del 4, and then the Dakota Street alternatives, Del 1 and Del 2. Of note is that for all of these stations, while they are a couple blocks apart, but for all of the stations, the vast majority of riders are going to be accessing the station from the south by bus.",transport
"In particular, the RET priority communities that live further south, a half mile or further south of the station, are really going to be accessing the station by bus. And so of critical importance is thinking about not so much where the station is located in that north Delridge area, but really about how does that bus rail integration work so that we are offering that seamless and safe experience for users of the system. Next slide, please. Thank you.",transport
"So this image provides an aerial view of the Delridge Valley. To the right, the system comes in from the Duwamish water crossing and exits to the left towards tunnels and elevated to West Seattle Junction. You see in the middle Delridge options 1A, 1B, 2B, 2A at Dakota Street.",transport
"You see Delridge 3 and 4 on the Delridge Way alternatives, and then on the furthest right or furthest north, you see Del 5 and Del 6, which are the Andover options. And it's Del 6 that would connect to the medium tunnel that is the recommendation of the city at this point. Of note is that there are tremendous differences in some of these alternatives and different opportunities that present themselves for each.",transport
"The two key priorities coming out of the racial equity toolkit work that we've done in the Delridge community are to provide for that excellent bus rail integration, as noted, because most of the community members that are coming from further south are going to be accessing the station by bus, but two, to minimize displacement and create opportunities for equitable TOD. So one thing to note is that the Andover option, the Del 6 alternative that is the city recommendation at this point, has the lowest residential displacement of all of the Delridge options and has comparable business displacement to some of the other options and actually significantly less than some of the alternatives that are on the table. Andover expects about 200 residential displacements.",transport
"So the rationale for this recommendation, and I just want to, you know, pause and take a note that a lot of time and effort has been has gone into this particular segment because all of these alternatives are impactful and all of the alternatives have opportunities and drawbacks associated with them. One key driver was looking for a way to from the community standpoint to avoid the effects of a tall guideway, including displacements and visual impacts over the residential community. And so actually, if I could ask you to go back to the previous slide very quickly, you notice that the Andover options that then skirt along the Newport Steel property before moving into the West Seattle Junction avoid the elevated structure over the existing residential community, whereas the preferred alternative in the DEIS, which is noted in pink, that is the Dakota Street alternative, would displace two to three square blocks of existing residential residences and would create this very high elevated guideway over that neighborhood.",transport
"Go ahead to the next slide again. This picture shows a rendering of what the Delridge Way alternatives could look like, again, showing the image of an elevated guideway through a residential neighborhood, creating shadows and sightline obstructions for that place where folks would be exiting the buses and getting onto the system. So this is what we're looking to avoid with the Delridge 6 option.",transport
"From the financial stewardship as well, the Del 6 alternative links to that medium tunnel, which provides for a roughly $500 million savings to the system. Next slide. What we've heard from community, minimizing displacement while maximizing opportunity for community-driven equitable TOD.",transport
"And so with that, we will be looking for opportunities if the Andover station moves forward to create a meaningful node there and to provide for some of that opportunity for affordable housing and other neighborhood amenities that have been identified in the North Delridge Action Plan. We've heard the need for additional engagement with the identified communities further south in the corridor. And then again, really to prioritize that seamless bus rail integration.",transport
"There's the additional engagement that was mentioned, ensuring safe pedestrian access and seamless bus rail integration. This has some challenges at the Andover site. And so we are actively working with Sound Transit and Sound Transit has already put on the table, some refinements to the Andover station that would provide for safer pedestrian access from south of Andover.",transport
"And we'll also in all scenarios be looking for strategies consistent with city code, but consistent with what we've heard from community to prioritize the protection and long-term restoration of Logfellow Creek. Next slide. So the final segment in the Duwamish West Seattle area is the Duwamish water crossing.",transport
The recommendation here is alternative Duwamish 1A for the south crossing. This is currently the preferred alternative identified in the DEIS. Go ahead to the next slide.,transport
"So the rationale for this recommendation is that there are alternatives that are the south crossing, which is just south of the existing West Seattle bridge structure. There's also an alternative that is north of that structure, the north crossing, and that the DEIS identified that the impacts to the north crossing alternative to the maritime businesses would be unmitigable, that it would not be possible to relocate and to mitigate the impacts to those sensitive businesses. But of important note, the south crossing does come with environmental and community impacts that we identified that were identified in the DEIS and that we've certainly heard during community engagement, including the significant adverse impacts at Pigeon Point.",transport
"That's associated with all of the crossings, but particularly the north crossing. Concern about tribal impacts near and in the Duwamish. Concerns about impacts associated with those south crossings to the West Duwamish green belt, including tree loss and wildlife impacts.",transport
"Those are the impacts at Pigeon Point, including tree loss and impacts to the blue heron habitat that are included in this photo from the DEIS here. We'll be working with them on that between the DEIS and the FEIS. Sound Transit also needs to demonstrate complete slope stabilization for any steep slope impacts as it comes across the Duwamish and into Pigeon Point.",transport
"Start with the positive first. Really appreciate, as relates to the Andover station, the attention to the need to minimize potential conflicts between pedestrians and freight movements in the station area. Appreciate recognition that there is divided community perspective for the Duwamish crossing and the language stating that there must be adequate mitigation of impacts to habitat at Pigeon Point and the West Duwamish Green Belt.",transport
"And want to say for Delridge, I do appreciate that there was additional language added to the draft resolution emphasizing how important transit access is for the area and emphasizing again, the need not only for a transit access study, but the need for additional protections for Longfellow Creek. The environmental justice analysis in the draft EIS only goes a half a mile from the station locations, whereas the communities identified in the RET are further to the south. As it relates to the fact that there is still a lot of concern and lack of a clear community consensus in the Delridge community about the support for for D6.",transport
"But the reality is, is that this is the only option that connects to the median tunnel. So that puts us all in a position that if we are supporting the West Seattle Junction median tunnel, then we have to support this option that has a lot of impacts that I am really concerned have not been properly analyzed. And I'm kind of throwing this out there much like we have stated no preference for the options in the CID.",transport
"I will say you brought up the medium tunnel and the reality of the, you know, the connection there. That is important, but I just want to reemphasize, I think for us, the, the RET analysis, the residential displacements in the Youngstown community, the, the impact of the aerial structure on Delridge and Genesee were really major drivers. Obviously, those are points we can, we can debate and discuss, but that was a really what was driving that concern.",transport
"And I'll, I'll just concur that the staff work and the staff recommendation was, was for this alternative, regardless of where it connected to the staff process that we went through, looked at each segment in isolation first and advanced, did, did the pros and cons and advanced this one again, as Marshall mentioned, because of those impacts associated with the elevated structure over the neighborhood. Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate understanding that dynamic and that support for the medium tunnel did not drive the selection of this alternative.",transport
"So starting with the SOTO segment. Go ahead to the next slide. The alternatives all follow the same alignment, but provide for slightly different configurations of the station itself.",transport
"The city recommendation is, the draft recommendation is for SOTO 1B. This is the at grade south station option that would have the new station closer to Lander Street and would also move the existing station closer to Lander Street. So I'll go ahead and the existing station closer to Lander Street.",transport
"It would also include a new vehicular overpass at Lander and at Holgate. The rationale for this was from a safety and user experience perspective, providing for better access from Lander Street to the station areas from a community standpoint, consistent with what we heard from the BIA and others, avoiding the displacements associated with alternatives that were further north. Go ahead to the next slide.",transport
"What we've heard through the community advisory group process, as well as through our conversations with community members, business owners, and the broader community support for this at grade south from the business community, both to improve that station access and to avoid some of the business displacements. We have heard concern about the design of the Lander overpass and reduced access to the properties that are on Lander between 4th and 6th, as well as concerns about construction impacts to businesses and mobility. This includes not only the roadways, but also the existing buses that come through the area, as well as the SOTO trail and an opportunity to think about the impacts and the long-term restoration of the SOTO trail.",transport
"Go to the next slide. So this, forgot to note, but most of these, almost all of these images are from the DEIS or from Sound Transit's online open house, and the citations hopefully should be noted on each slide. This is a cross-section of the suggested, of the recommended station at grade with that Lander overpass.",transport
"We do identify additional work needed to design the Holgate and Lander Street overpasses, to design them at acceptable grades for safe transport, to ensure that the intersections elevations at 4th and 6th, where those overpasses will connect to, can accommodate all vehicle types. And then planning for the long-term mitigation and restoration of the SOTO trail as an opportunity that this project brings. Go ahead to the next slide.",transport
"And then third, to initiate a broader community development strategy discussion and discuss how this project can be a part of that, that would further the right outcomes for this community and address the project's community, cumulative impacts and address the historic harm. Go to the next slide, please. So just a little bit of deep diving on some of the impacts and what we've heard and the rationale about the 4th Ave South and 5th Ave South alternatives, starting with the 5th Ave South alternatives from a safety standpoint and from a community standpoint.",transport
"Go to the next slide. Concerns, rationale and concerns about the 4th Ave South alternatives. So this would be a station that would be further removed from the heart of the CID community, locating it underneath the current, the current viaduct structure and the 4th Ave South bridge.",transport
"From a safety community and stewardship standpoint, need additional information on how to avoid and mitigate the impacts to the local and regional mobility and the nine plus years of construction and road closures and the very high costs associated with these alternatives. This picture is from the community advisory group meeting that showcases some of the partial and full road closures that are anticipated with this alternative. Of note, there would be the six-year closure of 4th Ave South that would be different staggered partial closures that would require the diversion of all of the traffic, the transit and general purpose traffic off of 4th Ave South onto 6th Ave through the existing community or over to 1st Ave South.",transport
We have also heard that there we have not heard any support for the deep alternatives. So just as a reminder the alternatives that are on the table for 4th Ave South and 5th Ave South have both a shallow configuration as well as a deep configuration. The deep stations would require elevator only access and particularly during surge events at the stadiums would likely cause a good deal of congestion.,transport
We've heard concerns about the 5th Ave South alternatives and their impacts to the heart of the CID community as well as some support for the 4th Ave South alternatives in particular because they avoid the 5th Ave South impacts but also because it would better connect to the Pioneer Square community. So we're going to pause there. The next step slide was already featured up front for Chinatown International District.,transport
Thank you. So we will we will move through downtown now. Downtown while the DEIS treats downtown as one long segment with five stations we're going to break it down for the purposes of discussion into three sub-segments including the Midtown and Westlake station then the Denny and Southlake Union station and then the Seattle Center station before moving into South Interbay.,transport
The current DEIS alternatives DT1 and DT2 offer different stations that provide different levels of access and benefit and certainly different impacts and so the alternative the approach here is to select stations from across those two alignments the DT1 and DT2 alternatives that would optimize that access and benefit while minimizing impact and harm. Next slide. So starting with Midtown and Westlake on the south end of that segment really going through the heart of the retail and office area of downtown the recommendation is for the two stations on DT1.,transport
This would be a tunnel at Midtown and a tunnel at Westlake at 5th Ave. So starting with the rationale before moving on to what we've heard from community this is a picture of the Midtown station at 6th so this is the rendering of what we're not proposing and from a safety and user experience the alternative for Midtown at 5th instead of 6th would avoid pedestrian and vehicle conflicts at the Spring and Seneca I-5 ramps that are shown here in this image as well as avoiding a very deep station at Midtown that would be elevator only access. As well thinking from that safety and user experience the Westlake station is similar to the proposed Chinatown International District station is a transfer point between the one line the two line and the three line and so thinking about that user experience that transfer environment there's a slightly shorter transfer distance between stations at Westlake associated with the DT1 option at 5th.,transport
Concerns about access from First Hill. So acknowledging that First Hill was bypassed by the original construction of the current system and that First Hill there are areas of First Hill that would be able to access this system and looking for opportunities to provide or improve that access. I have also heard concerns about access to the very deep stations.,transport
This is a picture from the DEIS of the Midtown station at 6th that would be accessible only at by elevator as the station deck would be over 200 feet deep. We've also heard concerns about safe pedestrian access. These are very steep slope areas of our downtown so really wanting to ensure that we have the safest pedestrian access as possible.,transport
Next slide. To additional work needed. So this is a rendering of the Midtown station or a map of the Midtown station at 5th Ave that would connect to the Rapid Ride G line on Madison Street which will be an important transfer bringing people into the system.,transport
"So we're looking for opportunities to optimize connection to the Rapid Ride G line to ensure sufficient vertical circulation in the stations and to possibly study horizontal access from 3rd Ave so we would provide access to the station at a lower level that would be horizontal. Next slide. So moving further north in the segment to the Denny and South Lake Union stations the recommendation is a mix and match approach where coming from DT1 we would veer over to DT2 at Denny for the Denny station, a tunnel station at Terry Street and then move back to DT1 for the South Lake Union tunnel station at Harrison Street.",transport
"This requires multiple mix and match refinements from what is in the DEIS currently. Of note both of these stations would provide access to South Lake Union which is the fastest growing center in the entire region with a growth of what is that 5,400 housing units and nearly 40,000 jobs since 2015. Next slide.",transport
Thank you. The rationale here from a safety community and stewardship standpoint. This is a rendering of the recommended station for South Lake Union at Harrison and 7th.,transport
This station would optimize transit integration and safe pedestrian access from the Aurora Corridor at South Lake Union so all of those buses that are coming down Aurora as well as connecting to Harrison Street which is a transit priority corridor identified in all of the city's long-term plans. So providing for that optimal transit integration at that point and safe access as folks are moving from the bus to the system. From a safety and community standpoint supporting access to the Cascade community and aligning with the Terry Avenue Green Street that's at the Denny station and then community and safety standpoint this mix and match approach would avoid the Denny station at West Lake and the Denny station at West Lake would create an untenable multi-year construction impact to the West Lake Corridor that I think we go into in the next slide.,transport
Yes so what we've heard from community we've heard strong and consistent support for the DT1 South Lake Union at Harrison station. It's identified as a community preferred location as a transit hub as well as hearing numerous concerns about access to the DT1 excuse me DT2 South Lake Union station at Mercer that would not have good pedestrian access and then concern about this alternative that we are seeking to avoid. These are the transportation impacts associated with construction of a Denny station at West Lake that's the DT1 station at West Lake which would require a four-year full closure of West Lake Ave through the heart of the the Amazon campus there would close down approximately two blocks for four years all access to that area so from the general purpose traffic bike and streetcar would and all of the existing bus lines that run through that corridor would need to be diverted elsewhere.,transport
So this is really seeking to avoid that multi-year closure of West Lake and the multi-year closure of complete closure of the South Lake Union streetcar. Next slide. Additional work needed so this is a map that's pulled from our South Lake Union Uptown Triangle mobility plan that identifies this very spot as a transit hub for the long term.,transport
So we are looking for continued study of the mix and match refinements to support this alignment so that requires additional work with Sound Transit and analysis to ensure that this that this mix and match alternative can work. We're looking for of course transit integration at that South Lake Union station that will be intersecting with so many bus lines from other communities throughout the city. We're looking for to ensure functional transit during the construction area and then at Denny station really looking for providing for safe pedestrian access on both sides of Denny which the current station alternatives do not do.,transport
Moving on in the segment to South to Seattle Center the draft recommendation is for alternative DT2 that is the tunnel Seattle Center station at Mercer Street and of note on this map the neighborhood context while this is called the Seattle Center station and of course it is meant to provide critically needed and benefit of transit service to the highest visited location in the entire region with over 12 million visitors per year and of course the city of Seattle is the primary property owner and landlord to the very many residential cultural and arts organizations that call that campus home but the station is also providing access to the Uptown Urban Center. It's one of the fastest growing urban centers in the city and in the region and this station is going to be providing access to that fast rapidly growing neighborhood as well. Next slide please.,transport
Rationale for this is from a community standpoint avoiding some of the impacts the unmitigable impacts to the sensitive users those performing and recording organizations on the Seattle Center campus that would be adjacent to the alternative the Republican alternative. From a safety and user experience standpoint providing access at Mercer providing a station at Mercer would give station entrances both north and south of Mercer which gives access both to the Seattle Center station or to the Seattle Center campus excuse me as well as safe access to the neighborhood so this is really about bridging both the campus and the neighborhood and making a station that would that would be meaningful to both. From an environmental standpoint avoiding the removal of legacy trees on campus that would be impacted by the Republican alternative and then this alternative would also provide greater TOD opportunity for some equitable development of parcels along Mercer.,transport
I think that closes out our downtown segment so look to Marshall to add additional context. Just a quick comment could you go back a slide for just a moment? I just wanted to use that refinement idea as an example the mix and match you see that green line connecting the South Lake Union and Seattle Center stations.,transport
Okay let's move on to the next segment. So moving on to South Interbay and the Interbay Ballard segments the system exits the Seattle Center Station and moves through a tunnel portal as an elevated structure then through Smith Cove there are some portions that would be some alternatives that would be at grade and then continuing north to alternatives that would either be elevated or tunnel up to Ballard and as you can sneak peek there the red circle tells you a little bit about what's ahead for South Interbay starting there. So the South Interbay segment go ahead to the next slide.,transport
Thank you. The recommendation at this time is that there is not sufficient information in the DEIS related to some key impacts associated with the construction and the permanent operation of the elevated guideway through the South Interbay area on Elliott Avenue West and the impacts to the environmental critical area for the city to make a recommendation at this time. The next slide will go a little bit more in depth into some of the concerns that informed that draft position.,transport
There are three alternatives through South Interbay. SIB1 which is currently the preferred alternative to the Gaylor Street Station. SIB2 and SIB3 would both have stations at Prospect Street.,transport
"The first rationale concerns about the Elliott Snake. So this is alternatives SIB1 and SIB2 would exit a tunnel portal at Republican and then would come out as an elevated structure that would weave across Elliott Avenue West three times in the course of a mile. The impacts of that structure would include many columns and structures that would be placed in the right-of-way in the roadway itself, permanent removal of turn lanes and sightline obstructions for all roadway users in that high volume break corridor.",transport
And these pictures here are pictures of existing conditions. The picture on top is Linwood Link north of the Northgate Station that shows what's called straddle bends with those columns that are placed on either side of the roadway and on the south. This is Central Link near MLK showing how a column can come down and permanently remove a turn lane and just gives a little bit of a sense of some of the sightline obstructions that can be associated with those structures.,transport
"Go ahead to the next slide. Meanwhile, SIB2 as it moves out of the elevated Snake area and then it would meet up where SIB3 would come out of a prospect portal would create significant impacts to Kinnear Park and the southwest Queen Anne Green Belt which is a landslide prone steep slope in an environmentally critical area. This is a picture from the DEIS from the top of that steep slope looking down towards Elliott Avenue that gives a sense of the steepness of that slope, that landslide prone slope.",transport
This is an identified freight mobility corridor near industrial and maritime uses and continuing to provide for mobility through that corridor is of critical importance to that business sector. We have heard support for the Gaylor Street Smith Cove station location and so importance is that their support for that station doesn't necessarily mean that the guideway that gets us to that station is without problems or impacts that need to still be addressed. Go to the next slide.,transport
"So additional work needed, next steps really to get to a preferred alternative. Looking to continue our work exploring refinements to address the concerns with this Elliott Snake. So looking at ways to modify the alignment so that it is not presenting quite so many impacts in the right-of-way again crossing Elliott Ave three times in the course of a mile.",transport
"If there are any alternative advances that provides that creates any impacts to the steep slope of Queen Anne, we'll be looking for complete slope stabilization. Prioritizing to maintain capacity on Elliott Ave West during construction for users and transit and then maintain Elliott Ave West safety lane capacity and property access issues and minimizing harm to industrial and maritime businesses throughout. Continuing north in the in this corridor to the Interbay Ballard segment.",transport
This includes stations at Interbay and at Ballard. The recommendation the draft recommendation is for alternative IBB2B which would be a retained cut Interbay station at 17th Ave West and a tunnel alignment to the Ballard station at 15th Ave West. Of note the Ballard station options that are on the table right now in the DEIS process include tunnel and elevated options at both 14th and 15th Ave West and that Ballard is by absolute numbers the fastest growing urban village in the entire city adding over 6200 people between since 2010 and the vast majority of that growth is happening in the heart of Ballard to the west of 15th and the majority of users of this transit system are expected to come by foot or or bike from the west of 15th.,transport
So rationale for this alternative from a racial equity and community standpoint avoiding the impacts to in water use or in water construction with the south with the ship canal crossing. So looking to avoid the impacts of the elevated structure the elevated options that would impact navigation would impact tribal use and would a tunnel option would lessen the land use pressure on industrial and maritime jobs that exist east of 14th Avenue Northwest. From a safety standpoint user experience providing for safe access west of 15th Ave so again acknowledging that this is the terminus of this line right now there's going to be a lot of folks accessing this system from the west of 15th and wanting to provide for that safe pedestrian access.,transport
From an environmental standpoint avoiding in water work in the ship canal to ensure or to lessen environmental impacts and then from a financial stewardship standpoint acknowledging that updated cost estimates for this system since the previous estimates in 2019 have shown that the cost difference between a tunnel and elevated options have decreased significantly although there is still a delta for the 15th Ave Northwest tunnel option. Go ahead to the next slide. What we've heard from community certainly very strong support for a tunnel alignment avoiding all of those impacts of an elevated alignment.,transport
We have heard strong support for the westernmost alignment and so right now that is the 15th Avenue Northwest but we have heard and certainly heard during community comment today members advocating for some of the earlier alternatives that were not moved forward in the DEIS including options at 17th and 20th Avenue Northwest have also heard concern from Fisherman's Terminal regarding bridge impacts on maritime dependent businesses. This is a rendering from earlier in the alternatives analysis that show the numerous other alternatives that had been contemplated at different points in the process. Of note is that there is additional work that is needed in this segment.,transport
We are looking for refinements to entrances on both sides of Market Street and 15th to provide for that safe pedestrian access there and refinements to resolve the property impacts at the interbay station site. So the interbay station that is proposed is the retained cut at 17th. That is the station that connects to the tunnel portals that are on the table right now.,transport
"And the current 14th Avenue station is located here. And in this section it's all industrial. And what I really appreciate about your resolution is item in Section 1 item C is really talking about what are the employment opportunities, what are the housing opportunities, what are the commercial.",transport
This is really important language and why this is so important to the Ballard and larger area community of North End and District 6 is the 14th Avenue alignment does not fit within this within these parameters. It's an area where we cannot add additional housing. It's an area that does not have our commercial core.,transport
It is an area that is geographically and physically separated from residential communities. And so I see in the resolution that we are asking for that our preferred option of our two choices is 15th. And I would say that from hearing from the community this is what I'd love to work with you Marshall and Sarah a little bit more to understand how I can advocate for our position in a little bit more nuanced way because I saw with Smith Cove area that there were some outstanding items that needed to be identified for us to really take a position because Sound Transit is proposing things that are outside of the EIS that we are responding to.,transport
And if the EIS that we're responding to changes I would have a lot of different comments to provide because on this map before us we see 20th Avenue and 17th Avenue which my good old handy map are you know here and here which is in the core historical core and current core of our commercial and residential area. We've got two new seven-story buildings going up on Market Street that are west well right at 24th and so that's to get to 14th that's a 10 block walk with a crossing of the third most used north south corridor in the city only behind SR 99 and I-5. So not only are we asking folks to walk 10 blocks we're asking them to cross essentially what is the next level down from Aurora.,transport
And that's why section 1 item c is so important and for me I I'm not sure that for that 15th is my preference out of the option between 14th and 15th absolutely but that's only because 14th really does not fit the needs of our community. And so I I'm not sure and I guess this is where and I guess this is where I ask you and if you want to talk offline I'm more than happy to. I'd love to find out how we can work with Sound Transit for them to understand this in a really tactile way because I there are original proposals of looking at 20th and 17th serve the community in such a more impactful way.,transport
You're saying the city is compromising by having 15th. That is already you know far further east than we would ideally want to put a light rail station to serve this neighborhood. So you know we're very much holding a strong line that that is absolutely essential for all the reasons that Sarah described.,transport
And it particularly relates to the South Interbay segment which is one of the locations where currently this resolution does not offer feedback on the alternatives that are indicated in the draft environmental impact statement. You know I appreciate the phrasing that we've seen on slide 60 in the presentation indicating support for the Gaylor Street Smith Cove station location. Well or at least that that's something that's been heard in the community.,transport
And I appreciate that being recognized here. I want to make sure that whatever action we take to go on the record we're making it really clear that the absence of an explicit endorsement of the preferred alternative still endorses certain station locations and functions that we would like to to see in what the ultimate alignment that is picked by Sound Transit is. It seems and maybe Marshall you can weigh in on this that the concerns about not endorsing the preferred alternative stem from the Elliott Snake issue and wanting to put pressure on Sound Transit to revise and fix that particular design problem before we can go forward and explicitly endorse one of the options.,transport
But I do just want to echo and state the concerns from a lot of constituents in Queen Anne and Magnolia about a very strong preference for a Smith Cove station and the West Gaylor station that are indicated in the preferred alternative and making sure that we're working to as we're pushing back on design keep that same kind of access that will allow for expedient and efficient transfers from those stations to get to Magnolia and to other neighborhoods adjacent to those stations and what that alignment provides. So I have a few more comments but I think I'll hold there if Marshall or Sarah you want to comment at all on mostly what's indicated on slides 56 and 57. Just briefly I'll offer council member I appreciate that I think that yeah your point about the station itself you know makes sense to a lot of people.,transport
I think that's shared at the city the Gaylor street location the issues as you described it and as Sarah presented really are primarily around the guideway and how it's been laid out and that's where we you know it fundamentally in terms of city policy feel that it's not consistent to support something like that at this point but want to continue to work with Sound Transit and really shine a light on that Elliott Snake issue is something that needs to get resolved so that we can fully support an alternative there. Can I ask a clarifying question to Marshall or Sarah? Where do we anticipate the tunnel coming out and turning into the guideway on this map?,transport
Like at what point does this go from a tunnel to being on the surface? Yeah and maybe if we move and you mean going from the downtown tunnel into south interbay not the Ballard tunnel into interbay? Yes from downtown into south interbay.,transport
So the for the SIB1 which is the preferred alternative in the DEIS to Gaylor street the tunnel portal is at Republican street and so if we go back a few slides there might be a little bit further there there we go actually that that last one I think maybe had now it doesn't quite show the portal so actually could you go back another couple slides I think I have one that shows where the portal location is but be happy to follow up with you certainly to provide greater clarity on it so in this the portals aren't identified clearly but we could follow up with with a map that does show it but as you see the Republican the Republican option at Seattle center which is that pink option down below that continues that continues west and would come out of a tunnel portal that is somewhere there where that gray line is and I unfortunately don't have in front of me exactly where where that tunnel portal is and whereas the Mercer station goes into the steep slope and then comes out of a tunnel portal closer to Prospect street so this is one thing that's not noted on the slides but is noted in our comments and our work with Sound Transit is that in order to go from the Seattle center Mercer station to the Elliott snake alignment that there would be a mix and match that a refinement that would be required there so we would be moving from Mercer into that Republican portal that would come out at Republican street. Sarah I have the map that Sound Transit has used in their presentation if you'd like me to put it on the screen. That would be great thank you.,transport
There we go so that Republican portal on the far left lower corner is coming out at Republican and fifth and then moves into an elevated guideway all along Elliott way that's the Elliott snake portion it continues to Gaylor as an elevated structure and then continues up to interbay whereas the and underneath that you can't see it because it's underneath it but underneath it is the SID 2 which also comes out of the Republican portal and then would actually have a station there at Prospect street instead and then continue in central interbay up 15th. Well okay I appreciate getting to see this diagram again but I think it kind of gets to one of the questions I had. Does our endorsement of the Mercer alignment inherently mean a lot of the issues with the Elliott snake would be avoided anyway given that it's a tunnel until West Prospect because the snake is that portion from West Prospect back down Elliott way right?,transport
It is but the and I'll I'll have to pull the language up but I think this might be if it's not explicit in the resolution perhaps we could call for it. The compatibility with the Seattle center Mercer is a high priority in this recommendation and so we could look to clarify that language in the resolution if it's not there. This is not meant to preclude preclude at all the getting to that Gaylor street station.,transport
What were the implications of of the tunnel in that comes out at Prospect B for the businesses that are between Kinnear Park and West Prospect on Elliott? Would that involve less acquisition from Sound Transit? I'm just I'm curious.,transport
The main issue with those with that alternative that comes out at that portal that's noted there at Prospect street is that that comes out at a location that is a very landslide prone steep slope in an environmentally critical area. So that's really the biggest concern that the city team has had and impediment to to moving forward that alternative is the the difficulty in achieving complete slope stabilization. Furthermore to to cite a light rail facility in an environmental critical area would be against existing city policy so you would need to have a designation of an essential public facility but then we would still need to work very closely with Sound Transit on that complete slope stabilization and I want to just underscore from a geotech standpoint the challenges associated with this slope and that the city team has very real concerns about the slope stabilization there.,transport
In addition Sound Transit has been exploring additional refinement concepts that would provide additional benefit or reduce risk or other concerns to the system. This includes and the city has been very supportive of this work including exploring the mix and match refinements that we've discussed throughout this presentation that would provide better greater flexibility across the system. Refinements to stations that would improve safe and non-motorized access so here is noted in this image providing better access north and south of Andover street for that Andover location if that moves forward in Delridge and then any refinements that would avoid minimize or mitigate adverse project impacts.,transport
