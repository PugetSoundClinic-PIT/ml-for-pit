requirement standards for the regulations that were adopted as the interim regulations.', 'And these regulations are due to expire on February 24th of 2021.', 'If the regulations are not extended, property owners in FEMA floodplain areas may not be able to purchase flood insurance or renew their existing policies.', 'So, the reason for the extension is that SDCI needs additional time to evaluate properties that are not mapped by FEMA but are mapped by SPU as flood prone to determine if additional areas need to be included in the regulations.', 'Also, public outreach and the environmental review for the permanent regulations have taken longer than we initially anticipated.', ""So, here's an example of an area in South Park where SPU has this area mapped as flood prone, but FEMA does not have this area."", 'So, we would like to make sure that we include every area that we know of that is at risk to flooding so that the regulations apply to those areas as well.', 'So, public outreach completed to date is that we do have a webpage up and running that provides information on the interim regulations as well as our work on the permanent regulations.', 'On that page, we have information for people to sign up to be on our email list to be included on future public meetings on the permanent regulations.', ""We've sent out 2,400 postcards to property owners in the mapped floodplain areas, and so far we have over 360 subscribers to our email list."", 'Our next steps will include public outreach that will include public meetings online and additional updates to our website.', 'We are currently working with SPU staff to evaluate those areas that I talked about that are mapped as flood prone by SPU, and then we are working on developing the permanent regulations.', ""So, if there's any questions, I can answer those questions."", 'Thank you, Maggie.', ""I do not have any questions because I've asked them at the last time that we passed this interim floodplain regulation and I also had questions at the last meeting."", 'So, all of my questions have been answered.', 'Colleagues, any further questions for Maggie?', 'Councilmember Peterson.', 'Thank you, Chair Strauss.', 'And for those who are tracking the new fiscal climate note, this legislation was initiated prior to the implementation of that, which is why the fiscal note does not discuss the adaptation issues that are impacting here, like rising water levels, etc.', ""But since this is just an extension of the interim regulations, we'll look forward to that when we get the final regulations to review so we can consider the rising water levels due to climate change, which would be answered through the adaptation question in the new climate note."", 'So, thank you.', 'Thank you, Councilmember Peterson.', 'Vice Chair Mosqueda.', 'Thank you very much.', ""I'm wondering if we could put this presentation back up just so I could see that map one more time."", 'There we go.', 'Thank you.', ""In this area of the map, I'm trying to orient myself here."", 'Are we talking, is this the South Park area here?', 'Yes.', 'So, this is in the South Park neighborhood.', 'And these are homes and businesses then in the South Park area there?', ""That's correct."", 'Yeah.', 'Okay.', 'And then with this, what was it, one or two weeks ago, there was that extremely high tide that we all saw pictures of that had water rushing over Altide Walkway.', 'Did any of the high waters that day also affect this area?', ""So, that's where SPU really keeps track of all those areas that are impacted during the high tides."", ""And so, we are working with SPU staff on all those areas that they're mapping and keeping track of during extreme high tides."", 'Okay.', 'Great.', 'And do you, sorry, Mr. Chair, this is just a slight diversion because the map is so powerful here.', ""Do we also have those maps that show the rising tides and perhaps this ties into Councilmember Peterson's longer term goal as we look at the impact of climate change?"", 'But I remember seeing some maps on how the various neighborhoods of Seattle will be impacted if climate change is not mitigated.', 'Do we have those maps that we could also reference for folks as we continue to lift up policies like these?', 'So, yes.', 'Again, SPU has these flooding maps as well as sea level rise maps.', ""And so, again, I'm working with SPU staff to evaluate the data that they have to see what we can do as we move forward with our regulations and planning."", 'Okay.', 'Thank you.', ""Maybe just a call to SPU and we'll be able to get my hands on those maps one more time just to refresh my memory on which neighborhoods we're talking about, though this affects everybody in the city and the region."", 'I appreciate you putting this back up there.', 'Thank you, Mr. Chair.', 'No additional questions.', 'Yeah.', ""And I can also send a link to SPU's website."", 'So, it is a public website where they have the flooding and the sea level rise maps.', 'So, I can send that to you as well.', 'Thank you very much.', 'Thank you, Vice Chair.', 'Thank you, Maggie, for this great presentation.', 'Councilmember Juarez.', ""I just have a quick question on the map because Maggie, I remember seeing a map a while ago and maybe I'm wrong, but are we included the unincorporated as well on the Duwamish?"", ""At this time, it's only the areas within the City of Seattle."", 'Okay.', ""So, but when it floods, it doesn't know the difference between incorporated and unincorporated."", ""So and I know that's an issue for the people who want to be whether or not they want to be annexed into the City of Seattle."", ""I remember that's been an issue."", ""Is there a way or I'm guessing you have the map for the unincorporated piece down in that area?"", 'Yeah.', ""So, there's where we could, okay, if you're asking if we can get information on that area, yes, we can work with King County staff because I know they have, they should have that information and I've heard reference to it in conversations."", 'So, I will, we can work with King County staff to get that.', 'Because we were, that was one of the issues on the environmental impacts and some of the questions that were coming up about annexation and those neighborhoods.', ""So, it doesn't, I mean, I just want to see the whole picture."", 'So, we have an idea how to work with King County.', 'Okay.', ""Yeah, because you know that there's money on the state side, on the county side and the state side for the floodplain stuff and mitigation and all these issues that come up from that area."", 'So, I just kind of wanted to see the whole picture.', 'Okay.', ""And you can, you can delineate what's, you know, within the city of Seattle limits, but we also need to see how that's going to impact our folks that are not in the annex, but still use the same roads, resources, employment, same buildings."", ""So, if you could, if we could see that, that'd be great whenever you get a chance."", 'Okay.', 'I will do that.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you very much, Maggie.', 'And seeing no further questions, we will move to open the public hearing on this bill.', ""And I'll just take this moment actually to ask colleagues, colleagues, are you feeling comfortable with passing this interim floodplain regulation today?"", 'Understanding that your information will come to you.', ""I'm seeing thumbs up."", 'Wonderful.', 'Thank you very much.', 'And so, before we open the remote public hearing, I would again ask that everyone please be patient as we continue to learn to operate this new system in real time, navigate through the inevitable growing pains.', 'We are continuously looking for ways to fine tune this process and adding new features that allow for additional means of public participation in our council meetings.', 'I will moderate the public hearing in the following manner.', 'Each speaker will be given two minutes to speak.', ""I'll call on one speaker at a time in the order in which they are registered on the council's website."", ""If you do have not yet registered to speak, but would like to, you can sign up before the end of this public hearing by going to the council's website at Seattle.gov."", ""The link is also posted in today's agenda."", ""Once I call on a speaker's name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt if you have been unmuted will be the speaker's cue that it is their turn to speak."", 'Please begin by speaking and stating your name and the item in which you are addressing as a reminder public comment should relate to CB 119978.', 'If you have comments about something else, you can always provide written comments by emailing my office.', 'Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left and there are a lot of time.', 'Once you hear the chime, we ask that you begin to wrap up your comment.', ""If speakers do not end their comments by the end of the allotted time provided, the speaker's microphone will be unmuted to allow us to call on the next speaker."", 'Once you have completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line.', 'And if you plan to continue following the meeting, please do so via Seattle Channel or the listening options listed on the agenda.', 'The public hearing on CB

police abuse and failed accountability.', ""We've all heard about Seattle Officer Eric Whitehead, paid well over $100,000 per year, who repeatedly refused to wear a mask in a hospital emergency room last week."", ""Officer Whitehead was also one of the Seattle officers who filed a civil rights suit against Seattle's police reform process, claiming that restrictions on his ability to use force constituted a violation of his civil rights."", 'So we now know that Officer Whitehead, in addition to displaying a total disregard for public health, also has a more general disregard for public safety and human rights.', 'But how could things be any different, given our complete failure of an accountability suit?', 'Last Friday, the Seattle Times noted, in relation to the many months of horrifying abuse committed by Seattle police, that, quote, the OPA sustained misconduct allegations or policy violations in five of 22 cases, only one officer so far has been disciplined with a written reprimand, according to records posted online, unquote.', 'Councilmember Herbold, this morning during council briefing, you stated, in regards to Officer Whitehead, that we should not have to wait for an OPA investigation in order to get corrective action during a health pandemic.', 'Do you think we should wait for an OPA investigation, especially repeatedly failed ones, for corrective action during a police violence pandemic?', 'Do you think it serves any measure of justice and accountability that, given that we are now well past the 180-day timeline for disciplining officers, that very few, if any, officers will face discipline or accountability for their abuses over the last eight months?', 'Hundreds of people exercising their First Amendment rights were beaten, severely injured, and falsely arrested over these last eight months.', 'It should be clear now that their abusers will escape justice.', 'The smallest measure of justice you could provide them now is to recognize the failure of police accountability and move to create a fully civilianized system under community control, to put more words into law rather than proclamations.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', 'Next up is Cindy Domingo, followed by David McLanahan.', ""And, Cindy, if you're with us, you'll have to hit star-6 to unmute yourself."", ""My name is Cindy Domingo, and I'm speaking to

encouraging to people in Cuba and all over the United States to have someone like Council Member Mosqueda and others on this council who have a deep understanding of the relationship between your role as policymakers and the interrelationship between domestic policies and foreign policy.', 'It is particularly important in this period as we face some of the darkest days yet in this pandemic, and as thousands of people are dying and will die over the next few months.', 'As we have said, a pandemic in nature is a global phenomenon, and thus requires a global response with global cooperation in all the fields of science, research, public health approaches, and preventive care.', 'This is required for this pandemic, but for also future pandemics and diseases that we have already, like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.', 'Global cooperation should be embodied, should be embedded in every approach to healthcare, because it will in the end save lives, especially if you are communities of color and forced communities.', 'Cuba has proven itself over and over again for 60 years that it is committed to the issue of healthcare as a human right.', 'So I hope you will vote for this resolution and join the other cities that have passed similar resolutions.', ""Together, we will save lives and end the inhumane U.S. blockade against Cuba, and I hope that one day soon we can travel

education to 5,000 students from all over the planet.', 'More than 100 students from underserved areas in the United States have received this free MD-level education they would not have been able to receive in our country.', 'The Cuban healthcare system is very, very impressive and is borne out by statistics, most of which are better than ours in the U.S.', 'A big reason for this is there is no

Obama was able to do and fully lift the economic blockade of Cuba after 60 years.', 'And also to take Cuba off the list of countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism.', 'This was done by the Trump administration literally a few days ago.', ""And it's particularly ironic that a country that has sent its health workers around the world for 60 years is being labeled terrorist by a president

against the crowd control ban."", 'These same crowd control weapons have been used against workers and oppressed people fighting for their rights around the world.', ""Recently, Modi's right-wing Hindu nationalist regime in India has used weapons on the mass farmer's movement, organizing against pro-corporate agriculture laws."", 'Elected representatives really need to fight for what workers and communities of color need, not what the racist capitalist court demands.', 'Along with council members and social alternative members today and the community police commission, there are many who are recommending that maintaining the crowd control weapons ban as it is does more to help improve community trust in the police, not less.', ""There's no excuse to roll back these serious measures to protect peaceful protesters and Seattle residents from lung and eye irritants used by the same police that have 19,000 complaints for use of force vial during these protests this summer."", 'Thank you.', 'Next, we have Grayson Van Arsdale followed by Karen Guylin.', 'Grayson?', 'Hi, my name is Grayson Van Arsdale, I live in the central district, and I think after witnessing the despicable police violence last summer, to drive such massive loopholes into the chemical weapons ban is really nothing short of a complete betrayal.', ""BLM protesters in Seattle, after being subjected to so-called crowd control weapons for weeks, after watching it be deployed on children, won this ban alongside council member Sawant's office, and I think any council member who is against police violence should vote no on these loopholes."", ""The chemical weapons ban is fully enforceable as is, and council members shouldn't dishonestly pretend otherwise."", ""The proposal to water down the chemical weapons ban is bad wholesale, but I think especially egregious is the part that only bans pepper spray in the non-violent demonstration, when so often we've seen police classify a person or situation as violent, when reality has been entirely different, and this proposal has no recourse for that."", ""Pepper spray and other chemical irritants can cause serious and lasting medical damage, they're weapons of war."", 'This bill gives police a total get-out-of-jail-free card, as if they need any more of those.', ""Lastly, I want to address the false argument that if non-lethal crowd control weapons are not permissible against certain situations, it will lead to lethal force being used unnecessarily, which is essentially saying that if police cannot maim protesters, they will kill them, which is, if this is a serious argument that is being brought forward, it's a stunning indictment of the Seattle Police Department, which warrants more action, not a weakening of restrictions, and points to a need for true community control of police."", ""It's really clear that this proposal and these loopholes are a concession to the court system that has consistently let cops off scot-free for their abuse, rather than standing with a movement that has endured these chemical weapons to fight for racial justice."", 'So the Democrats on City Council, who profess to support the movement for racial justice and against police brutality, now supports these loopholes.', ""I'm not surprised, but I'm disappointed."", 'And thank you, Councilmember Sawant, for standing with us.', 'We need more people like you, and we clearly need a new party for racial justice and working people.', 'Thank you, Grayson.', 'Thank you, Grayson, and the next speaker is Karen Guyland, followed by

Matter movement is ebbing, so-called progressives are trying to undo a major victory that was won by our movement over the summer.', ""So long as police are allowed to act under their own discretion, determining whether or not a protest is nonviolent, it's inevitable that the movement will reach high tide again, and the movement will remember where council members stood today on this vote."", 'The chemical weapons ban was a landmark victory for the George Floyd and Black Lives Matter movement that spread nationally last year, where the police repeatedly used these weapons against peaceful protesters, most notably in D.C. when Donald Trump tear gassed Black Lives Matter protesters for a photo op.', ""We should also remember the other photos that define the movement, young people's eyes who had been shot out by rubber bullets by the police."", 'Winning this ban was the first gain in – it was an early gain, first gain for community control of the police, and now so-called progressive Democrats want to give police back discretion over when and where they get to use these weapons by determining themselves whether or not this is a nonviolent protest.', 'But the police need to act under our discretion, under the discretion of working people and the community, not their own.', 'We need more control over the police, not less.', 'We need an elected oversight board with full power to hire, fire, and subpoena them – full power to hire, fire, and subpoena police.', ""But yeah, I'd just like to reiterate that, right, the movement isn't gone."", 'It will come back, and the movement will remember where people stood today.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you, our next speaker is Blythe Serrano, followed by Valerie Chourette.', ""Hi, my name is Blythe, I'm a renter in Mount Baker, and I'm calling in to testify against the gutting of the crowd control weapons ban."", ""I'm particularly appalled by the fact that under the revised bill, private right of action, which gives ordinary people the right to sue for $10,000 any time the police use a prohibited crowd control weapon against them, would only apply when the police use banned weapons during a non-violent demonstration."", 'But SPD themselves are the ones who get to decide whether they consider a given demonstration to be non-violent or not, and as we saw over the summer, they declared peaceful justice for George Floyd protests to be violent, and even a riot, whenever they wanted to use crowd control weapons to clear the streets.', ""So this legislation essentially gives SPD the freedom to use crowd control weapons whenever they see fit, and eliminates ordinary people's right to sue when crowd control weapons are unjustly and illegally used against them."", 'The bill also removes all restrictions on the use of weapons such as rubber bullets, which were responsible for at least 115 serious head injuries at BLM protests over the summer.', 'It also significantly reduces the restrictions on police use of pepper spray, which is banned for use in war under the chemical weapons convention.', ""I find it, quite frankly, impossible to understand how any Seattle City Council member can advocate for the city's police department to be allowed to use weapons that are banned even in war against their own constituents."", 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', 'Our next speaker is Valerie Shloret, followed by Madeline Olson.',

weapons ban.', 'You know, throughout the summer, across the country, we saw that peaceful protests by justifiably enraged communities were met with police brutality and violence, which was the very thing that set off the George Floyd protests.', ""Here in Seattle, the movement was able to win a landmark chemical weapons ban, and this has been a first step in real accountability of the police, accountability that's been absent when we talk about the six police officers that participated in the D.C. violence."", ""But now there's talk of leaving loopholes in the ban, putting us right back where we started."", 'If the council is committed to taking responsibility for the damage done to all the people who stood up for the serious and real injustice they saw within their community, they need to uphold the ban with no loopholes, no pepper spray, no rubber bullets, no tear gas.', ""Leaving the use of these less lethal weapons up to police officers' discretion is clearly not working, which is why we need real police accountability, a real, like, community oversight board over the police."", 'Thank you for your time.', 'Thank you.', 'Our next speaker is Sarah Gonzer, followed by Margo Stewart.', 'Sarah.', 'Hi.', 'Yes.', ""My name is Sarah, and I'm a renter in District 3."", ""I'm also calling about the chemical weapons and so-called crowd control bill, and to talk about why

out and got out this incredible victory."", ""And I think it's really unfortunate that Democrats on City Council are even discussing this, and that, you know, this victory came out of the, you know, long and hard-fought BLM movement this past summer."", ""And yeah, we absolutely need to protect what we've won, and, you know, as other people have spoken about, this is a thought in the face of the

we've seen barely any with next to no disciplinary action in response to 1,900 complaints of misuse of force over that summer."", 'And I think there can be no real accountability if we leave these decisions up to what an individual officer deems is necessary.', ""We've seen countless cases of officers brutalizing unarmed victims under the completely bogus and retroactive defense of fearing for their lives."", 'If we insert such loopholes, we would essentially have no ban at all.', ""And it's not surprising to me, but it's deeply disappointing that Democratic Councilmembers who have claimed to support Black Lives Matter would push such loopholes after what we saw last summer with weapons that are deemed unfit for even open warfare."", ""If we're going to have police in our communities, then we need them to be democratically accountable to us, the ordinary working people who live there."", 'And I think this is crucial to build trust, especially knowing that at least six officers were involved in the far-right violence at the Capitol on January 6th.', 'More broadly, though, ordinary people need a real recourse against any sort of police misconduct, as well as the Democratic power

workers.', 'First, I urge you to ensure that mass vaccination sites are accessible.', 'At least three-quarters of our food bank customers arrive by walk, bike, or bus, so considering transit accessibility when siting these locations is critical.', 'Also consider how you leverage nonprofit partners to improve your distribution effectiveness.', ""Like many of my food bank peers, we have hosted flu vaccine clinics and public health nurses, and for the food bank participants of these clinics, if we didn't host the clinic or the nurse, our customers wouldn't seek that help."",

want to urge Council and Public Health to use your position and relationships with Washington Department of Health to help food bank and meal program staff and volunteers all receive vaccine access during phase one, tier B2.', 'Even before COVID, food bank work was physically and emotionally challenging.', 'We are trying to meet and support some of our most vulnerable neighbors at some of the most difficult and challenging times of their lives.', 'With the additional necessary precautions needed to remain safe during COVID, our work is just that much more challenging and exhausting.', 'The city has generously helped us source PPEs for our staff, volunteers, and customers, but PPEs are not enough.', 'Even with these protections, we regularly endure and manage COVID exposure.', 'Food bank staff and volunteers have been exposed to the virus, at times requiring agencies to temporarily shut down their services.', 'The thousands of food bank staff and volunteers in Seattle are critical frontline workers.', 'The emotional toll on staff and volunteers the last 10 months cannot be understated.', 'As our community still faces heightened levels of hunger, please work to protect our food bank staff and volunteers.', 'Please make the vaccine available to all these essential workers as soon as possible.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', 'At this time, I would like to extend public comment for another 15 minutes and to reduce the public comment speaking time for each speaker from two minutes to one minute, so that we can try to get everybody in.', 'And if there are no objections from my colleagues on the council, the agenda is amended to add an additional 15 minutes of public comment.', 'Seeing no objection, the agenda is amended, and we will move on to the next speaker.', 'And the

entirely by Democratic Party politicians, brutally attacking this peaceful, multiracial, Black Lives Matter protest, night after night.', 'They even pepper sprayed a child.', 'So hundreds fought alongside Councilmembers Sawant to force the Democratic establishment to pass the first in the nation legislation banning Seattle police from owning and purchasing these weapons.', ""Elected representatives need to do what's right for the community, working people, and communities of color, not what you believe the courts of capitalism demand."", 'You must preserve this full ban on

know, making a tiny reform."", ""So as a socialist, I'm asking for a complete revolution of this economic system, which trains its police officers to use a racial eye to enforce prison sentences and fines, and if you see a police officer and your skin is a certain color to feel a certain anxiety because it does a lot more capital."", ""It's a racist, sexist system."", ""And so I think what Black Lives Matter was about, you know, more socialist-type thinking, and that's why the ban on chemical weapons needs to be enforced."", 'If you look at other countries, like Egypt, where an Egyptian

react."", ""I'm going to fight back."", ""So if you continue to use these weapons, you're not going to get the situation that you want, which is calm things down."", 'It will make it worse, and more

include the zoning restrictions that can segregate permanent supportive housing to narrow areas of the city and limit sites, drawn-out design review processes that some estimate can add up to 18 or more months on average to project times, and then broad requirements that don't match the use case of future residents, and these requirements can limit valuable capacity for housing units and add

residents who use mobility aids to get around.', ""And of course, it isn't just the streetcar that's impacted the CID."", 'Our neighborhood is surrounded by fast-moving arterial roads and is cut in half by an elevated 12-lane interstate.', 'We are asking this committee to help ensure that the new light rail station and its surrounding station area do not repeat the mistakes of the past and

Jonathan Hopkins followed by Jacqueline Gruber.', 'Go ahead, Jonathan.', 'Good morning, chair and committee members.', 'On behalf of Seattle subway, I want to thank the committee for engaging on the topic of Sound Transit realignment.', 'We hope the council will think critically about what realignment executed now will mean for our city and we hope the council will ask Sound Transit a few critical questions that deserve answers.', 'This realignment process will have immense negative impact upon our city.', 'Core to the realignment proposal are concepts to massively delay light rail connections to Alaska junction, as well as moving quick wins, quote-unquote, such as the C&D line improvements to 25 years out.', 'This is a big deal.', 'The realignment process was created with failure as the core assumption and central precept, willingly giving in to breaking faith with voters.', 'Sound Transit says, quote, sustainability is part of our daily business, unquote, yet in an era when we have nine years to avert a cascading series of ecological disasters, how can a transit agency willfully give in to delaying critical projects into the 2040s?', ""That's an ecologically unserious effort by an otherwise great agency."", 'We have two questions.', 'First, why are we doing this now?', 'Mayor Durkan, Dow Constantine, and Claudia Bilodeau rightly called for a pause to realignment.', 'Why?', ""Because it feels like we're lowering the bar without a basis in known facts."", 'The affordability gap has fallen by nearly $4 billion in just five months, which is proof that we have no clue at this time what the gap really is.', 'We should not lower the bar without knowing that.', ""Second, why hasn't Sound Transit organized for success, creating a working group focused on what they need to do to complete all rail projects on time or early?"", ""It hasn't done this at all."", 'Note that ST2 and ST3 actually did that, filling gaps for prior projects to complete those on time or nearly on time.', 'Thank you, Jonathan.', 'And again, everybody, just send your e-mail, your comments to us as well.', 'We really appreciate your time this morning.', 'Next we have Jacqueline Gruber followed by Lisa Howard.', 'Go ahead, Jacqueline.', 'Hi, council.', ""My name is Jacqueline Gruber and I'm here today representing Vulcan to comment on ST3."", 'We are among the stakeholders of several ST3 station areas and believe that transit is critical to the health, equity and vibrancy of our city.', 'Sound Transit 3 represents a pivotal opportunity to expand our transit network and meet our equity and environmental goals.', 'Getting it right will not be easy.', 'Thoughtful attention and analysis is necessary to better understand and overcome the recent cost increases and deliver the package promised to voters.', 'Finalizing the exact station locations and design will require meaningful community engagement but it should not be rushed.', 'We must ensure that stations are thoughtfully designed, accessible and enable seamless transfers between modes all while minimizing unnecessary impact to ground floor businesses, civic institutions and arts and cultural organizations during construction and into the future.', 'While this work will be challenging, the benefits will be long-lasting.', 'They require our intentional and deliberate planning.', 'Thank you for initiating the dialogue to deliver the promise of ST3.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you, Jacqueline.', 'Next we have Lisa Howard followed by Kathleen Johnson.', 'Go ahead, Lisa.', 'Hi.', 'Thank you, Councilmember Peterson.', 'This is Lisa Howard with the Alliance for Pioneer Square.', ""First off, I want to thank you for hosting this discussion and we hope your leadership here kicks off a series of discussions regarding Westdale's Ballard Link extension."", 'We need the leadership of the entire city council, particularly this committee, to ensure that the project that Seattle City Council is committed to is built for the city.', 'We hope that you will use this forum as a regular opportunity for council to identify and meet project planning needs inside the city.', 'A key goal for the south downtown community is that the project and all future major infrastructure projects are developed in a way that implement and reflect the priorities of these two historic neighborhoods.', ""For decades, people in both areas have engaged in dozens of outreach and planning efforts and over that time, consistent and durable themes have surfaced, including the importance of the city's infrastructure and the sustainability of the city's infrastructure."", 'Over the years, consistent and durable themes have surfaced, including public safety, comfortable, safe and accessible public spaces and design that connects the two neighborhoods and the people who live, work and play here.', ""Jackson hub began as a joint community effort and thanks to Mayor Dworkin's leadership, the city has taken on delivering the Jackson hub station area planning process to build on these past community-led planning efforts, raise up community voices and improve coordination within and among agencies."", ""We're grateful for the work that the city of Jackson has done to inspire city agencies to develop outcomes from the process that will guide the responsible design and hope you will support these agencies in their work."", 'We look forward to ongoing collaboration with this committee and thank you for your time.', 'Thank you.', 'Next we have Kathleen Johnson followed by Jamie Lee.', 'Go ahead, Kathleen.', 'Thank you, chair Peterson and vice chair Strauss for this opportunity to discuss the Washington, the west Seattle ballot rail extension project.', ""I'm Kathleen Johnson, executive director of the state agency charged with investing in the vitality of the two historic neighborhoods of Chinatown international district and Pioneer square."", 'We are grateful to Seattle for providing financial support to HSC to provide capacity to neighborhoods to fully engage in the WSBLA planning process.', 'The WSBLA project is the largest single investment in transportation infrastructure in Seattle.', 'The alignment runs from west Seattle ballot entirely within the city.', ""We welcome the council's leadership to ensure the project is planned, constructed

history of bearing the negative impacts of major infrastructure projects."", 'While the benefits include people living in other parts of the city, county, state and even country.', 'Think of I-5 which cuts the CID in two and destroyed the vibrant center of the neighborhood including family homes and businesses.', 'Or the two stadiums which bring joy and community people all over the state.', 'While south downtown handles the cleanup, public services and traffic.', 'The list is literally endless.', 'And for that reason, the state founded HSC to invest and help elevate the voices of the

preservation development authority.', 'When I started working for SCIPTA seven years ago today actually, the first hill street car construction had finished and one of my first projects was to help the community mitigate the impact that construction had on the neighborhood.', 'I saw firsthand the impact not only on our businesses but on the trust and belief our community had in that particular transportation upgrade.', 'The communication and thought given to our neighborhood was lacking and it took many years for us to recover.', ""I don't need to tell you that the west Seattle to Ballard link light rail station is a significantly larger project."", 'This is a once in a generation project likely to impact the neighborhood more than the construction of I-5 and it is a 100-year plus transit project.', 'You, the city, have acknowledged that transportation infrastructure projects like this disproportionately impact downtown without centering the voices of BIPOC voices.', 'There is a great possibility that this project will fall in the footsteps of many others that has planned something through our neighborhood for other parts of the city, not for our neighborhood.', 'I urge you as our city to work closely with Sound Transit to ensure that this project takes into consideration the needs of our small businesses and residents of the CID as they make up the fabric of what makes this neighborhood so unique.', 'We need our elected leadership to be involved in the realignment process and upcoming stages of environmental review.', 'We need the mayor and council to make sure that

before speaking.', 'First speaker is Michael Ruby followed by Morgan Littlefield.', 'Please, good morning, Michael.', 'This is Mike Ruby and I am speaking on the Seattle City Light draft strategic plan.', 'My comment is that Seattle City Light has presented you with a strategic plan that fails to address adequately the needs of the city to respond to its ongoing climate change that we are all unfortunately experiencing.', 'I want to point out that when the 2018 IRP, integrated resource plan was presented to the city council by Seattle City Light, the first two bullet points in the executive summary of its report focused on conservation and the importance of energy and efficiency investments in the building stock of our city and how that would create the equivalent of a new power generation plant.', 'In fact, in the second item that they say there, conservation investment remains the first and best resource choice as the most environmentally responsible way to meet the Washington Energy Independence Act needs and enable City Light and Bonneville Power Authority hydro generation to displace fossil fuel generation impacts by others in the region.', 'However, I would like you to turn to page eight of the financial forecast appendix they have provided you with and is attached to the agenda.', 'This does not project any increase in spending for conservation over the four-year period.', 'Rather, by having a flat amount which increases by less than one percent each year, it is essentially decreasing because City Light itself acknowledges that it is trying to build into this plan a three percent per year inflation rate.', 'The City Light strategic plan and other places in the document forecast an even higher inflation rate.', 'Thank you, Mr. Ruby, and we do have the email that you sent to council members as well.', 'Next is Morgan Littlefield followed by Cindy Laws.', 'Go ahead, Morgan.', 'Good morning.', 'I am Morgan Littlefield with Climate Pledge Arena.', 'I would like to thank you for this opportunity to share our support of amending on-street parking rates for events.', 'Climate Pledge Arena strongly supports the proposal to increase on-street event parking rates to $12 or higher and to expand the RPZ in uptown.', 'We also support this rate adjustment extending to Sundays and holidays.', 'The proposed plan balances out some critical public policy objectives.', 'By expanding reserved parking for residents in uptown, those who need to have available on-street parking will be able to access that parking more easily.', 'Increasing on-street parking rates will help reduce congestion by reducing the number of people that will drive to the neighborhood and hunt for on-street parking.', ""In addition, making street parking rates comparable to garage rates will encourage those who drive to use Climate Pledge Arena's parking reservation system to secure a spot before they arrive."", 'At Climate Pledge Arena, we are striving to be a good neighbor not just to our fellow Seattle Center resident organizations, but also to our surrounding neighbors in uptown, Queen Anne, Belltown, and others.', 'That is why in concert with supporting this legislation, we are working to make sure that more arena attendees take public transit, bike, walk, and use options other than driving to get to our arena events.', 'We attended several community outreach meetings on this topic and think the city did a good job of reaching out to both businesses and residents about the impacts of these parking changes.', 'Like Uptown Alliance, we believe that the council should adopt the legislation.', 'Thank you very much.', 'Thank you.', 'Next, we have Cindy Laws followed by David Strauss.', 'Go ahead, Cindy.', 'And just a reminder to press star six to begin speaking, Cindy Laws.', 'Cindy, if you can hear us, please press star six to begin speaking.', 'Okay.', ""We'll come back to Cindy Laws."", ""Next, let's hear from David Strauss followed by Rosio Medina."", 'Hello.', 'This is David Strauss.', ""I'm speaking about CB120103 regarding the Georgetown steam plant."", 'Starting off with the importance of the Georgetown steam plant.', ""It's a national landmark."", ""It's a Seattle landmark."", ""Based on the fact of its innovative construction, it's associated with an important figure, Frank Gilbreth."", ""It's an important part of Seattle's history and really an important part of the urban context, especially in Georgetown."", ""Landmarks are most instructive when they're in use, and the use proposed by the community development authority is ideal."", 'Monthly tours, in addition to occasional events, have been effective in teaching technology history, but to only a few people.', 'So the CDA is proposing science, technology, engineering, arts, and math instruction.', ""So the project's going to open the steam plant to a much greater number of people, including younger members of the community as a place for science, technology, engineering, arts, and math education."", ""It's also going to open up to an increasing number of events, so really exposing the steam plant to a greater public."", 'The lease will facilitate opening the building to a broader public, and in the process, improve the soundness and safety of the building.', 'So I urge the council to approve the ordinance.', 'Thanks very much.', 'Bye.', 'Thank you.', ""We just have two more speakers, and then we'll come back to Cindy."", ""For now, let's go to Rosio Medina, followed by Deborah Frostow."", 'Go ahead, Rosio.', 'Hello, can you hear me?', 'Yes.', 'Okay, thank you.', 'Good morning.', 'My name is Rosario Medina.', ""I'm a Georgetown resident, and I would like to echo everything that David Strauss just said."", 'We are in support of the ordinance to authorize the chief executive officer and general manager to execute a long-term lease and operating agreement for the Georgetown steam plant, which will incorporate community development.', 'And historically, the Georgetown community has not had much access or community connection to the historic site with this new vision of incorporating science, opening the doors, having events with the community and for the community and for the broader people who are also interested in the history of Georgetown and the people and this amazing landmark.', 'We are in very support of that.', 'And this would also provide opportunities for our youth to learn about the history in their community and to continue sharing that and having a role.', 'So this brings very many opportunities that the Georgetown community has not had in a very, very long time.', ""And I'm in support of this ordinance."", 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', ""Next, we'll hear from Deborah Frostow, followed by Cindy Laws."", 'Go ahead, Deborah.', 'Hello.', 'Hello, my name is Deborah Frostow.', ""I've lived in Uptown for over 15 years and serve as Uptown Alliance's committee chair on arena issues."", ""We are in support of ESSTAT's recommendations for the changes to the parking rate structure."", 'Transportation and parking have been at the core of so many countless discussions over the last three years as we get ready for the new Climate Pledge Arena.', 'We want to thank ESSTAT and especially Ruth and her team for engaging with us and more broadly within our community in developing this parking legislation.', 'So today, as you consider their recommendation, we would like you to know that Uptown Alliance supports a progressive rate structure even as high as $12 an hour.', 'We also support extending event rates to include holidays and Sundays, days when there will certainly be many events going on at the arena.', 'Progressive rates can be confusing.', ""It's easy to be concerned if you think that someone who pays for two hours for a 6.30 dinner reservation might pay $16 or $24 in parking, when in fact that's not how it works."", 'That person would pay closer to $6.', 'Instead, we believe the concern should be that if we do not have higher event rates, then the parking on the street will be so attractive to arena event goers, they will choose to look for curbside parking instead of parking in one of the event garages and leaving no open spots available for those who want to go out to just grab a coffee, go to a restaurant, or shop at the market.', 'Uptown Alliance believes that what Uptown is suggesting is a good balance for our residents, small businesses, and the tens of thousands of event goers and deserves your support.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you, Debra.', 'Our last speaker is Cindy Laws.', 'We tried her earlier.', ""Let's see if she's here."", 'Cindy, if you can hear us, press star six and go ahead.', ""Cindy, if you don't mind sending us, if you're not able to press star six and speak now, please do send us an email to council at Seattle.gov."", ""It'll reach all nine council members."", 'Can you hear me now?', 'Yes, yes, we can hear you.', 'Thank you.', 'I think I pushed star six about 12 times.', 'Sorry about that.', 'Thank you, council members.', 'I appreciate this opportunity to call.', ""I'm calling about an urgent matter that's not on the agenda that I hope you can introduce a resolution."", 'As you may have heard, two people, two more people were killed by the light rail train in the Rainier Valley on Friday.', 'That brings to number 10 people that have been killed, pedestrians have been killed by light rail since 2019.', ""At the April 22nd meeting of Sound Transit's board, there was a presentation on the safety stuff relating to collisions."", ""There's been 140 collisions with vehicles in that time frame."", 'There are three things that even though that only one of you are on the Sound Transit board, I do hope that you can push hard.', 'There are three things that can be done.', 'As we all know, when the city adopted Vision Zero a couple of years ago, it was to have zero pedestrian deaths.', ""We've had 10 just from light rail since that time."", 'The three things that can be done is to insist that Sound Transit install railroad crossing arms at every crossing in the Rainier Valley.', 'Those are installed in SOTO.', 'Those can help the people that have made the decision to try to outsmart or out walk or whatever.', ""They're not paying attention."", 'For whatever reason, we need to make it more clear that there is a train coming.', 'That would help a lot.', 'The flashing lights, the ringing bells, and definitely the crossing arms can help.', 'Two things that SOTO can do is to extend pedestrian crossing times.', 'In this case, pedestrians were crossing the light.', 'The third thing would be to install an island mid intersection so people cannot make it across MLK can at least wait in the middle until they can safely cross.', 'Thank you very much.', 'I hope you can issue a resolution and get these things moving forward so that we can have greater safety in this horribly dangerous corridor.', 'Thank you.', 'Colleagues, that concludes our speakers for this committee meeting.', 'We will close the public comment period and move on to the first

piece of property, but you should know that the part of the property used for such affordable housing will be reduced in value by half."", ""The reality is limiting the definition of affordable
