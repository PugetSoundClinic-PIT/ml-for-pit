# About This Course

Welcome to Machine Learning for Public Interest Technology.

## Intro

### In this course we will...

* learn about public interest technology
* explore methods for analyzing large text based datasets
* apply pre-existing machine learning models
* practice implementing supervised machine learning models for text classification and span categorization
* combine techniques to analyze a dataset of city council meetings

### We will need...

* experience with Python and common scientific Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`.
* basic understanding of vectors and linear algebra
    * If you need to brush up on linear algebra, we recommend [3Blue1Brown's excellent "Essence of linear algebra" series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* a google (gmail) account for access to Google Colab

## Getting Setup

This course is taught using Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab.

Each chapter will have three parts:

1. A "lecture" / "reading" portion where we will first go through and explain the concepts and the code for the task at hand.

2. At the end of each lecture, we will link to an exercise that you should open in colab and try for yourself.

3. Finally, at the end of each exercise, we will include a link to reference code for how we have completed the exercises.

While the exercises should be completed interactively, all course content is reproducible. If you ever want to play around with the lecture example code or the reference code, you should feel free to do so by clicking the Launch in Colab button.

#### TODO

* create test colab notebook that has basic commands
