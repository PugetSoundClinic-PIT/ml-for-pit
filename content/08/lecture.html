<ul class="simple">
<li><p>there are a lot of questions we can ask about this data. but generally a good place to start is by asking something simple that may reveal a larger pattern for further investigation</p></li>
<li><p>for example, lets try to answer the question “how are public comment’s typically structured in city council meetings?”</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Planning<a class="headerlink" href="#planning" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>our first step in this process is to break down how we can answer our question</p></li>
<li><p>within each meeting, we will want to identify the sentences / portions which are public comments – when you are working on identification problems, <strong>classification</strong> is always a good place to start</p></li>
<li><p>we will also want to look into the structure. a few examples of public comments might be (note, the names and organizations are made up, but the sentence structure comes directly from meetings of the Seattle City Council):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Good afternoon, Councilmembers. My name is Lisa and I’m speaking for Parents for Police today. And we, I’d like to support, here to support the appointment of Bill as Executive Director of the CPC. …</p></li>
<li><p>Hello, I’m Bryce Chin, Chair of Justice Washington and a District 7 constituent. I am speaking in opposition to the SPOG MOU. …</p></li>
<li><p>Hi, council members. My name is Tim Brown and I live on Capitol Hill and run a small business in Soto. I’m calling today to urge you to vote no on the SPOG memo of understanding. …</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>we can see that there are a few different structures here. some people introduce themselves, some people introduce their organization, some people introduce their district, they usually say what they are speaking about, and then they say what they want the council to do</p></li>
<li><p>To start, lets try to breakdown comments by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“self-introduction” - the speaker introduces themselves</p></li>
<li><p>“org-introduction” - the speaker can optionally introduce themselves but additionally introduces an organization</p></li>
<li><p>“other” - the speaker does not introduce themselves or an organization</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>this is a complex task, and one we can likely train yet another classification model for but we might want to use something to help us annotate data</p></li>
<li><p>before we do any of this, we will probably want to work with a small dataset before scaling up to the entire corpus</p></li>
<li><p>lets start by trying to identify the start and end of the public comment / public hearing sections of the meeting</p></li>

This morning we will start with Isaiah Corbray, Pastor Willie Seals, and then Taylor Latrice Horner. Good morning, Isaiah. Apologies for interruption. Thank you, Mr. Corbray. No problem. Thank you for the opportunity. I&#39;m calling in support of agenda item number 11, that&#39;s council bill 120227, an ordinance relating to street vacations. I&#39;m calling in support of this legislation as it will encourage additional growth of direly needed affordable housing in Seattle. It will also support the Christ Spirit Church in Lehigh, the Low Income Housing Institute, and developing almost double the amount of affordable housing units for homeless youth and young adults in the central area. Some of the expenses related to the cost of land for street vacations can be an incredibly high barrier for community-based organizations hoping to develop affordable housing. And this council bill will support those organizations, those community-based organizations in having access to additional land for density to build affordable housing. So I appreciate everyone this morning supporting this legislation and thank you very much for the opportunity. Thank you for dialing in this morning. Pastor Willie Seals, good morning, followed by Pastor Seals will be Taylor Latrice Horner. Good morning, Pastor. Good morning. My name is Pastor Willie C. Seals, the pastor of the Christ Spirit Church, as well as the president of T.C. Spirit Development, calling in reference to item number 11, also amassing and thanking the council for addressing this issue that many non-profits and other agencies are having regarding the added expense of the street vacation. So amassing that the council, the full council will support this effort. We all are facing this homeless crisis and we are trying to address it in the best way we know how. And I think this is a great opportunity for the council, the whole council to get on board of a great action. Our project that we are working with Lehigh on on 22nd and Terry with the added street vacation, it would add additional 23 affordable apartments moving from four stories to six stories. So council, I ask that you will pass this bill, that we will address the issues of homelessness in a tangible way. Thank you so very much. Thank you very much for calling in. Taylor Latrice Horner will be followed by Collin Moen. Good morning, Taylor. Hi. Thank you. My name is Taylor Latrice Horner. I am an apprentice with local 46 and it is important to all local 46 members that our employers pay for our parking. And I wanted to comment on the suggestion in the memo that this legislation would incentivize workers to drive who might otherwise use public transportation. As workers who have called in before have said, including myself, for the vast majority of the people who work in this industry, public transit is not an option. So to allow contractors to opt out if they incentivize public transit would effectively destroy the intent of the legislation. I also feel like public transit could also be incentivized. Some contractors already do both. And if employers had to cover the cost of parking, they might be more concerned about how inflexible transportation is for so many of the workers. Also, I urge you to not delay the effective date. Local 46 members know that when decisive action is made, especially over something as simple as a parking reimbursement system, which many contractors already have partially in place, it takes very little time for administrative systems to assemble themselves. So all delays read to me as attempts to protect the financial interests of influential people. Contractors really need elected officials to earn our trust in this moment. So do city council members consider themselves to have been elected by the people who voted for them or by the people who bankrolled their billboards and cable ads? Local 46 is following this legislation closely, so thank you for your time. Thank you very much. And Colin Mullen is listed as not present. Colin, if you want to call in, we&#39;ll come back to you. The next person is Arthur Esperanza, followed by Nina Wirtz. Good morning, Arthur. Looking for Arthur to pop on the screen here. Star six to unmute. Good morning, Arthur. I see you unmuted. If you&#39;re speaking, we can&#39;t hear you. If you can hit, check your own cell phone or your landline. Yeah. Oh, there we go. Yeah. Now we can. Please go ahead. Yeah. So my name is Arthur. I&#39;m the chair of the Peter G. Maguire Group. We&#39;re the largest workers caucus of carpenters, union carpenters in the Pacific Northwest. The carpenters have supported many city council members in the past. And as you know that we just got through with a pretty dramatic strike, which ended in trusteeship for the EST. I want to say that I support item number 12 to have contractors provide or pay parking for employees. I want to say that we don&#39;t want this thing watered down. We don&#39;t want any carve outs. We don&#39;t want to be walking a mile, half a mile with no parking reimbursement. None of that stuff. Look, we take hundreds of pounds of tools to Seattle to go work on projects to build that city, to build this city. And it&#39;s a totally reasonable request to have employers provide us with parking. And the city needs to make it happen in order to grow and make this city successful. And that&#39;s what&#39;s going to really build the economy in the long term. Otherwise, we&#39;re not going to want to work in Seattle. Okay. I got a lot of my members. We no longer want to work in Seattle. They&#39;re looking for jobs elsewhere. They&#39;re basically trying to boycott the city. We need to have this parking bill passed. It&#39;s going to help Seattle. It&#39;s going to help construction workers. And we don&#39;t want it to be watered down. Thank you. Thank you. And Nina. Nina, words followed by Logan Swan. Good morning, Nina. Star six. Perfect. There we go. And Nina, I see you unmuted just double-checked your own cell. Hi. Hi. This is Nina Lowe. I&#39;m a carpenter at a local 30 speaking to the 12th item on the agenda. No more delay. Today, it is time for the Housing and Finance Committee and the rest of the council to stand up for the carpenters and all construction workers. In September, a near-unanimous city council vote increased renters&#39; rights by requiring six-month notice of any rent increase and payment relocation fees when it&#39;s 10% or more. I&#39;m asking you today how supporting us construction workers in our fight is any different than supporting renters. Most of us can&#39;t afford to live where we work. And on top of skyrocketing rents, we pay upwards of $30 a day before we even start work. That means if we work a 40-hour week, we&#39;re only getting paid for 35 hours. You showed sympathy towards renters in September. Time to show solidarity to construction workers now. Looking at this water bomb draft, it seems like you forgot. Council Member Sawant originally proposed this, consulting with real construction workers. Here&#39;s one of the issues with the memo. The environmental impact study. Now, I&#39;m one of the few lucky carpenters who live in the city. But in south Seattle, which doesn&#39;t seem to get the same bike lane coverage as north Seattle gets, surely if I&#39;d be expected to haul my tools onto a bus at 5 a.m., I should be able to do it on a bicycle as well. Were any actual construction workers consulted when drafting this? Or did you just talk with the AGC? We already have tool storage. But keeping our tools on one job site only helps when we stay on one job site. What about folks who bounce from job to job? And if we work more than one job in one day, I guess that means we&#39;re paying for parking twice, too. The reality of construction work necessitates cars as our primary transport, whether we pay for parking or not. You must stop making excuses to backpedal to Council&#39;s promises of solidarity for workers now. If you really cared about the environment, you&#39;d never support billionaires who dump more carbon emissions in one space flight than one family does in their lifetime. As a reminder, I want to remind folks that the memo that&#39;s been referenced is a nonpartisan central staff memo. And it is a factual document that is not drafted by Council members, just as a reminder. Logan Swan, followed by Thatcher M. Bolden, and then Dominique Johanovich. And that will conclude the public hearing. And we&#39;ll go back to the public comment. And then we&#39;ll go back to Patrick Burns, who has signed up for the public hearing. Logan, good morning. Thanks for dialing in. Yeah, can you hear me? Oops. Yes, we can. Thanks. Oh, OK. Yeah. My name&#39;s Logan. I&#39;m a union ironworker here in Seattle. And yeah, I&#39;m just calling to demand that, you know, that there be no delays, no watering down of Council Member Swan&#39;s bill for contractors to fully pay for construction workers&#39; parking. I mean, it&#39;s really cut and dried. You know, either somebody&#39;s going to pay for this, and either it&#39;s going to be the workers or it&#39;s going to be the employers. In my contract, my union contract, we have employer-paid parking. And, you know, this should be the standard. And so if our, you know, signatory contractors can afford to pay it, you know, surely the electricians, MECA contractors can pay it. Surely the general contractors can pay it. And furthermore, they&#39;re paying it on the PLA jobs already. Like, so for, you know, that there are slides in the presentation, you know, saying that, you know, that, like, arguing about significant administrative costs to employers, like, that&#39;s good. Because otherwise, that&#39;s significant costs to working families. And, you know, these, overall, I think that these are, like, paving the way for, like, watering down the bill. And it should be passed in full without any amendments that weaken it, that give, you know, these contractors a way to walk away with more of our money. And, yeah, I mean, furthermore, like, referring to PLAs, you know, it already says in the PLAs for the three-block radius. And, you know, there&#39;s an argument being made in this session, you know, to expand it to half a mile. And, you know, that&#39;s a long way when you&#39;re carrying, you know, 80 pounds of tools, daily carrying in your lunchbox and your tools. So, yeah, like, you know, every week that goes by on this is a week that construction workers are subsidizing contractors. You know, this is a big issue on family budgets. This is over $100 a week for workers. Thank you. And Thatcher and Bowdoin, followed by Dominic Johanovich. Good morning, Thatcher. Good morning, Councilmembers. My name is Thatcher and Bowdoin, and I&#39;m the Director of Land Use Planning and Development at Sound Transit. I&#39;m here this morning to express our support for Agenda No. 811, that&#39;s Council Bill 122027, which would exempt affordable housing projects that receive street or alley vacations from the requirement to pay fair market value for the underlying land. Sound Transit has had a strong partnership with the City of Seattle and other jurisdictions in using our surplus property for affordable housing, including significantly reducing or transferring at no cost property for affordable housing, which is somewhat similar to what is being considered here for vacated transportation right-of-way. We also have property in Seattle that may be used for affordable housing in the future, and those properties often are adjacent alleys that are likely good candidates for an alley vacation that could benefit from this bill. The City contributing the underlying value of the vacated property towards creating affordable housing would have real impact, both reducing the amount of other subsidies needed to construct affordable housing and by making projects more cost-effective and thus more competitive for affordable housing funding. Thank you. Thank you very much. The last person that I have signed up for the public comment period is Dominic Johanovich, who is listed as not present. Colin Moen and Dominic Johanovich, if you would like to send in your public comment, that would be welcome. Okay, colleagues, at this point, I will go ahead and move us into the public hearing for agenda item number nine. I will close out our public comment period.&quot;]

&#39; the HHS and CDC need to provide more accountability mechanisms for how are they monitoring and tracking these types of distribution mechanisms and what are they doing to ensure that these incidents don&#39;t happen again? And what will they do also to remediate what happened, right? So we can&#39;t just say, fine, it happened. No, now we need to also have some more accountability for that. And so just wa&#39;

This is a presentation and a body of work that Council Member Herbold has been leading on, and so I know she&#39;ll be joining us for that as well. And lastly, we&#39;ll have a briefing and possible vote on the Sound Transit&#39;

&#39;Once again, I just urge the council to tell the community, tell us that you care about people over profits, and I urge you to pass hazard pay. Thank you. Thank you very much for your time. Thanks for everybody for calling in today. That concludes everyone who is on our list and present. That will conclude our public testimony from today, and let&#39;s move on to other items on our agenda. Madam Clerk,&#39;

&#39;il support for their expansion. So I am really appreciative of Madame chairs action here today in just allowing my anticipated reaction from my colleagues to the effect that they weren&#39;t ready to move to be the action of record that we end up taking today. I was feeling bad when it wasn&#39;t in the chairs package. I really appreciate correcting that here. The CSO&#39;s are very supported in the community&#39;

&#39;nt with a fuller understanding provided by the board on the benefits and risks.

We&#39;re talking about, yes, that is correct. We&#39;re not talking about what you think about is, like, the rats and everything in our city, but more the threats to the urban forest where I can&#39;t remember how many years ago, sorry, I apologize, I&#39;m the hydrologist, so I might be not using the right terms, but as far as bringing in the different diseases and different bugs that will wipe out set species, and one of the things is we have a ton of maple trees, and if there&#39;s a threat to maple trees, we could easily lose a lot of our urban forest, and so trying to understand how much of what type of urban forest we have is very important to understand how we need to respond, and, again, this is being kind of, it&#39;s a multi-departmental team, but one of the gaps was including, getting SDCI kind of more integrated, and we&#39;re concerned because so much of the urban forest canopy is within our, on private property. If I may add a little bit. Please. Thank you. So this is actually the lead for the city, but this is a regional effort, and Seattle Parks and Recreation, Seattle Public Utilities, other urban forestry departments are very much involved. I also wanted to just point out that this kind of issue is another one of the kind of fallouts of climate change where we&#39;re having drier and hotter summers, which tend to place an impact on the health of the trees, and when they are kind of weakened by ongoing drought, then it&#39;s easier that they are invaded and succumb to pests like the emerald ash borer. ESR has done a great job with the street tree inventory, and they have a great accounting of how many of the street trees are ashes and how many are kind of like potentially going to be lost once the emerald ash borer gets here. So all of this planning, again, is regional, and the city is part of that regional effort and SDOT is leading that. Thank you, Sandra. I guess I&#39;ll do a real quick point. I&#39;m seeing we&#39;re getting closer to time for the urban forest management plan update. One of the things that in the draft we commented on was a lot of the narrative of tree versus development versus densification, and so trying to break that narrative up and similar, like South Lake Union has gone through a ton of development, has gone through a ton of densification, and its tree canopy has been increased. So one of the things is just trying to break down that narrative to be more specific and define the terms that we really want to acknowledge are creating the friction of preserving our trees. Next slide, please. And if I may just really quickly, I just would like to respond to what I heard in public comment. I just wanted to clarify that as part of the work that the urban forestry team has done, we have included, and I&#39;m speaking now as part of the urban forestry core team. We included the urban forestry commission in key ways. In 2018, when we were just getting going with the plan update, we held a listening session in July to make sure that we understood the commission&#39;s vision for the plan update. Then we held two different deliberative sessions to be able to share with the commission. One was in March, and the other one in August of 2019, where we shared with this smaller subcommittee of the commission the initial assessment that we had done, the inclusive engagement plan, and kind of like the findings of that important work. We shared a potential plan structure, as well as initial goals to be discussed, and for the commission to have the opportunity to weigh in. Then we also shared later in 2019 the progress that we were achieving, specific actions, performance indicators, all of these to be able to inform the work that the team was doing to update the plan. Then in 2020, we kicked off the public comment period with a briefing in detail to the urban forestry commission in October. I just wanted to say because I feel that finding creative ways to engage the commission without having to have a big, elaborate public meetings, but really get their key experience in all of the skills that they bring to the table, that&#39;s why we&#39;ve been having these deliberative sessions. For sure, I personally don&#39;t believe that we are considering the commission just another member of the public. Thank you. Thanks Sandra. I want to just, with interest in time, highlight the Forest Health Watch Project and iSeeTree. Those two organizations are utilizing or are using web platforms to engage youth in public in research and in education, and we found that very encouraging to try to instill the appreciation for our urban forest and nature in the community. Next slide. For our internal operations, we again just want to highlight that one of the things we were doing by reevaluating our bylaws, different protocols, was to make sure we stripped out any restrictive language and with regard to eliminating gendered pronouns, and then also we wanted to make sure that in the prompts to both presenters and ourselves, we took a moment to make sure that we looked at different conversations through the race and social justice lens so that we build that into our bimonthly meetings and all the different coordination we have with the partners. That also tied into our annual meeting between the Urban Forestry Commission and the IDT team, where we were looking at training, we participated in training on racial equity and the urban forest, and that also went into how to reevaluate how we are providing material to the public and making sure that it is as accessible as possible. Thank you. And that will be back. Next slide. Yep. Back to Weston. Thanks, Sarah. Just to wrap up here real quick, and then I&#39;d love it if there&#39;s time for a question or two, looking towards this year, and these are things I think you&#39;ve generally heard about, the urban forest management plan update, obviously tree regulations, the one we haven&#39;t talked about yet is the slide issued last year and I think is supposed to be due back to you all in September, and this is focused on restructuring urban forestry management within the city. Obviously a very big issue. As you know, currently nine departments work on trees and vegetation in the city, and an auditor report almost a decade ago showed that perhaps there&#39;s some efficiencies in urban forestry management that we could be capitalizing on if things were restructured. And a lot of this is tied up in the ordinance and issues of protection and regulation and how do we most effectively get to those. We&#39;re looking at removing any potential conflicts, conflicts of interest. And so engaging with staff on the slide is a big part of our upcoming year, and in fact the commission has called out specifically in this slide to be a co-creator of recommendations. So I&#39;ll go ahead and I guess leave it there and open it up to see if any of you have questions, comments, anything else for us. Thank you, Wes. And thank you, Sarah and Sandra. Colleagues, questions? I see Councilmember Peterson with your screen on and your Save the Trees. I&#39;ve got mine right here, too. Welcome. Take it away, Councilmember Peterson. Thank you, Chair Strauss, and I just want to thank everybody on the Urban Forestry Commission for their work. One of my staff members attends most of your meetings and we did look at this work plan and we&#39;re happy to see the scope of it. Obviously, we&#39;d love to see things achieved even earlier. We know our executive departments are under a lot of strain from the COVID pandemic and other things they&#39;re doing, and so we&#39;ll just continue to work with the commission and appreciate your sage advice and expertise in these areas. Thank you. Of course. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Peterson. Colleagues, any other questions? I guess I&#39;ll just wrap up by saying this last picture that you show is illustrative of the importance of protecting both street trees and providing those opportunities to protect the trees on private property. Not knowing the zoning or where this photo was taken, if the zoning allowed for it, we could have a more dense neighborhood in this photograph and protect trees. And so, again, density helps protect the environment and address climate crisis as well as trees. Thank you all again for having us. As always, feel free to utilize us as a resource. We&#39;re here to serve you all. Let&#39;s get tree protections passed. If you&#39;ve got challenges, if you&#39;ve got roadblocks, we&#39;re here as a resource. Thank you, Weston. Thank you, Sarah. Thank you, Sandra. And moving on to the next agenda item, again, thank you to our last presenters. Our final item on the agenda today is Council Bill 120001, the Bringing Business Home Bill, a small business flexibility bill. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the abbreviated title into the record? Item 3, Council Bill 120001, an ordinance relating to land use regulation of home occupations adopting interim regulations to allow home occupation businesses to operate with fewer limitations during the COVID-19 civil emergency. Thank you. I spoke about this legislation at Council briefing on Monday morning, and I&#39;m excited to have it here in committee today. I&#39;m proposing the Bringing Business Home legislation with Council President Gonzalez, and as well, Council Member Mosqueda would like to sign on as a co-sponsor here, and we can open that up to other members if you&#39;d like to join us. For us to be able to provide additional flexibility to small and micro businesses and entrepreneurs during the pandemic, it recognizes that as business owners have been nimble and found creative ways to stay open during the pandemic, our city&#39;s land use regulations have not been able to keep up with the changing environment in which we live in. An example of that you may be familiar with, as we heard in public comment today, is Yonder Bar, Yonder Tasting Room in Greenwood, and Yonder has been welcomed by its neighbors and created a place for community during a difficult year, during a year where we have to be physically distanced, which has directly impacted our ability to create community, and Yonder has really done a great job of fostering that. Unfortunately, after a complaint was filed with the city, Yonder was found to be out of compliance and closed last week. They were found in compliance by both the Liquor Control Board and by the Department of Health. I want to also just make sure that it&#39;s front and center to everyone&#39;s mind. This bill is not about Yonder. This bill is about all of the small businesses, micro-businesses, and entrepreneurs who are operating in our city. There&#39;s a pizza shop just down the street from me that if they were to receive a similar complaint, they would be found out of compliance, and this is another great entity that provides vibrancy in the neighborhood for people who are licensed massage therapists, people who are mental health therapists, people who are operating their businesses out of their homes. They need to have the flexibility to survive and thrive during this pandemic. This is a temporary bill, and this is really meant to ensure that we are supporting our entrepreneurs to find the success. As I said earlier this week, that some of the most successful businesses in this country and in this world started out of garages, and we should be doing what we can to support them. As small businesses are struggling to survive, the last thing we need to do is force them to shut down. This legislation will allow more small businesses to stay open, operate out of residences, and providing the businesses an alternative to high commercial rents and while they add vibrancy and community to our neighborhoods. With that, I will hand it to Ketel Freeman who will walk us through the legislation. Mr. Freeman, welcome. Thank you. Ketel Freeman, Council of Central Staff, and there is a presentation that is attached to the agenda, and I will share my screen with that presentation here. Are you all seeing that? Okay. Yes. There is an initial briefing on Council Bill 12001, which would amend the land use code to temporarily modify regulations for home occupations. I&#39;ll talk a little bit about the purpose of the bill, what our current regulations are, what&#39;s proposed to change, and then what the next steps are associated with the bill. With respect to purpose, and these are stated in the findings of fact, which are at the beginning of the bill, as the Councilmember knows, Councilmembers know, when the Council annexed interim regulations, there needed to be findings of fact to support those interim regulations. But they are COVID-related. They would allow home-based businesses, including those that may have once operated out of a brick-and-mortar location, to operate with fewer restrictions from people&#39;s homes during the COVID civil emergency, and that hopefully will allow small businesses to remain operating to speed economic recovery after the civil emergency restrictions are lifted and businesses can operate more freely. So how does the land use code currently regulate home occupations? So currently, home occupations are allowed as an accessory use to a residential use in all zones. So there&#39;s not a zonal restriction on where home occupations can be located. They can be in single-family zones, multifamily zones, commercial zones. The home occupation has to be operated by a resident of the residential use. So somebody could not lease out their garage to somebody else to operate a home occupation. And you don&#39;t actually need a permit to have a home occupation. You don&#39;t need a land use permit to have a home occupation. You just need to comply with operating requirements, and those operating requirements include limitations on the number of commercial vehicle deliveries and pickups by day. Appointments have to be by—customers can only visit by appointment only. There cannot be walk-up customers. The residential appearance of the building has to be maintained. No more than two nonresidents or no more than two employees may work at the home occupation. That doesn&#39;t include folks who may be residing in that dwelling unit. The home occupation cannot substantially increase traffic and on-street parking in the vicinity. Home occupations can have signs, but they&#39;re pretty small in size. And the sort of the things that you would associate with more intense business activity like outdoor storage and noise, odor, dust, light glare, those are not allowed to be associated with home occupations. Do you guys have any questions about what the current regulations are? Not so far from me, because I&#39;ve been well-versed in all of this, but opening up to colleagues. Any questions? Seeing none— Not yet. Oh, Council Member Peterson. Not yet, but for later. Thank you. I&#39;ll keep going here, then. So what would change? On an interim basis—that is, one year—home occupations would not be subject to limitations on the number of employees at a business, the type of customer visit—so there could be walk-out customer visits—and limitations on increased traffic and parking would not apply to home-based businesses. I omitted something from this slide—apologies for that—but also, as drafted and as introduced, the requirement that a structure with a home-based business retain a residential character would also be modified as well. Additionally, home occupations would be allowed to have a larger sign—720 square inches—and just by way of reference, for those of you who have been in City Hall or are sitting at your desk in City Hall right now, the standard size of a stand-up city desk is about twice 720 square inches—that&#39;s about half the size of a standing desk in City Hall. And finally, spaces that may be occupied by required parking or used for required parking could be used for the home occupation. So if you have a garage that satisfies the requirement for a required parking space, you could use your garage for your home-based business. So, next steps. As I mentioned, this would be authorized as interim development controls, and that means that the Council still needs to hold a public hearing on the bill. There&#39;s a committee meeting scheduled for March 10th. The public hearing can happen after Council action, so assuming that Council approves the bill, that hearing would be scheduled 60 days after Council action. The bill does establish a work program for the Seattle Department of Constructions and Inspections to propose permanent changes to home occupations. Those could just be a refresh of our current regulations, or they could be something broader depending on where we are with the COVID civil emergency about a year from now. So that is my brief on the bill. I&#39;m happy to answer questions that you guys might have. I have a few, but Council Member Juarez, take it away. I think Council Member Peterson was ahead of me. Is this the time? Because I can... Council Member Peterson? Please go ahead. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. Is this the point where we have a bunch of questions for Ketel now about this whole thing? Yes. Is there more to come? This is... Okay, good. I think that is... The next slide says questions. Okay. Okay, so I&#39;m going to be just real frank. As it stands, I cannot support this, and let me just tell you why, and I know that we&#39;re going to have a hearing and we&#39;re going to clean it up and we&#39;re going to do more. I understand the intent and the spirit and the passion, I get it. So number one, I have three questions and then Ketel can answer or not answer. We can just, as Council Member Herbert loves to say, put a pin in it and come back to it. We need a better definition of interim because you have it as COVID-19 civil emergency. We don&#39;t know how long that will be. That could be months, that could be years. I&#39;m concerned about that. I&#39;m concerned about, I understand the desire to protect existing small and micro businesses, but this would also create more small and micro businesses out of people&#39;s garages. If that&#39;s the case, which is fine, my concern is what would be this impact to the existing small businesses when it comes to parking, competition, and also in light of the fact we are encouraging people not to use third-party apps for delivery. So small businesses and restaurants get 100% of the fee or the cost of the revenue instead of just 85. So I&#39;m concerned about those small businesses on spines like Aurora, Lake City Way, Ballard. If you have businesses operating out of your driveway, and we don&#39;t know for how long, as long as COVID-19 is going to be around, where there&#39;s more signage, more parking, you can have as many employees as you want. This could go anything from operating selling cider to being a masseuse to, does this mean, as I told my husband on the phone an hour ago, can I, I said, hey, good news, I can open up the driveway and sell fry bread. So does that mean I can just open a business in my driveway, right, you know, if this were to pass as is, for as long as COVID is around, to compete with all the small businesses and restaurants four blocks away, with none of the constraints of regulation, permitting, all the things that small businesses have to comply with for parking, employees, all of those things, it seems to me that we may be creating an unfair playing field for those existing small businesses that we are indeed trying to protect and keep open. As you&#39;ve done, Council Member Strauss, to your credit, making sure that our sidewalks could be open so small businesses could, you know, seat people outside, have coffee outside. Does this mean that I can open up an espresso stand in my driveway and sell lattes to all my neighbors while Coffee Clatch, four blocks away, isn&#39;t going to get their business anymore? This is the kind of stuff that I&#39;m concerned about. I am supportive of the intent, but the application, where we get a little wonky, is where I get concerned. So I&#39;m going to be quiet after this. Thank you. Council Member Juarez, I love it. You always bring the best questions and you nailed something that is really important to me as well, which is that we&#39;re not moving our business districts out of our business areas and into our neighborhoods. To answer some of your questions, and Keto, please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, you would not be able to operate fry bread or coffee out of your driveway. You would be able to operate it out of your garage. I know that&#39;s a small difference and, you know, it doesn&#39;t change the intent in which you shared, which is Coffee Clatch. Well, out of my garage, I&#39;d definitely put a stove in my garage then. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Out of my garage, my two-car garage, my huge two-car garage and driveway is huge. So great, I can sell fry bread and fireworks. Thank you. Yes, and to your point about making sure that we&#39;re not creating an uneven playing field about what other levels of government are regulating, whether it&#39;s Department of Health or Liquor Control Board, these other levels of government still have their jurisdiction. So to your point of, you know, to operate a, to do fry bread, you would have to have a commercial kitchen. And so that, just as it stands, the incentive would still be for a commercial, there are already existing commercial kitchens that you could rent for cheaper than you could build in your garage. So there&#39;s really a lot, the intent here is to help create the code changes for existing, for what is already existing. And the interim, and Quito, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, I believe it is for one year rather than for the duration of the COVID pandemic. I know we had initially talked about the COVID pandemic, but to your point, Council Member Juarez, we didn&#39;t, we wanted to create a set timeline for this interim measure so that we could create, to take the time and process for any permanent changes to occur in a thoughtful way. Quito, do you want to correct me if I&#39;m wrong? Yeah, I can speak to that. Interim here has a specific meaning. It&#39;s a meaning that comes from the Growth Management Act. So this bill would be authorized under a section in the GMA, section 3670A390, and that allows local governments to put in place interim, what are called interim development controls. A local government can&#39;t put in place an interim development control that lasts longer than a year. And hence the kind of the structure of the bill, which has a work program for SDCI. That allows the Council, that would sort of give SDCI the opportunity to come up with something that could be more permanent or could just be a refresh of our current regulations that make modest changes that the Council could consider by November or so. But under this particular pathway, the Council can&#39;t authorize something that is longer than a year. In the future, the Council could consider an extension of it, but at least the intent of the bill is that SDCI provide a proposal for the Council to consider before the regulations expire. Okay, so I just quickly, Council President, I mean, Council, or Mr. Chair, I was just looking at the fiscal note, the summary and fiscal note. I know you haven&#39;t done a memo yet that you&#39;re going to get to us next week, I understand. So I was just reading the heading and the, well, the whole summary and fiscal note, and it just says, it just says during the COVID-19 emergency. Yeah. I missed that somewhere, I apologize. Yeah, and so my apologies if the fiscal note is not clear, but if the bill as drafted now would expire 365 days after it becomes effective. Just to speak to a few of your comments, Council Member Juarez, I mentioned that as it is now, a person doesn&#39;t need a land use approval from the city to operate a home-based business, provided they just have to provide, they just have to comply with the development standards that are associated with the home occupation. There may be other permissions that they may need from the city or from other bodies that have regulatory authority over them, like King County Public Health or the State Department of Health. So for example, if somebody wanted to operate, sell coffee, for example, out of their driveway, they may need some, they would probably need an approval from Seattle King County Public Health for that. That&#39;s something that Seattle King County Public Health regulates, not SDCI. You mentioned Freibrand, as you guys are probably aware, last year there was a bill to allow microenterprise home kitchens. There&#39;s a state regulatory framework that precludes those types of kitchens from operating out of people&#39;s homes. There is a bill this year, HB 1258, and as of this morning it looked like it was in committee in the House that would establish a private pilot program for microenterprise home kitchens. So something like that would need to pass for those types of uses to be authorized as a home occupation in the city of Seattle. So there is a state framework above the city&#39;s land use code that would regulate it. Okay. I can cook other things besides Freibrand. I just threw that out there. So I don&#39;t want the front page banner of the Seattle Times to say Council Member Juarez is going to sell Freibrand. So let&#39;s just get that cleared up. Thank you. And to that point, Council Member Juarez, using Yonder as an example here, they opened as a tasting room and not as a bar. So that is an important distinction there. And then from there with the COVID pandemic, it is unsafe for them to have people inside of their garage because their garage was built for a Model T. If they had a two-car garage, I think that they would be in a different situation. And so just understanding that those are the small nuances that we&#39;re intending to create the flexibility for, and all of your points I think are really valid. This is the second time that I&#39;ll say it today. You teach me well, Council Member Juarez, and you make us all better people. Well, you don&#39;t always listen to me, Mr. Strauss, but I&#39;ll let that go. That&#39;s fair. That&#39;s fair. Colleagues, any other colleagues? Council Member Peterson, do you have questions? Yeah, take it away. Thank you, Chair Strauss. Thank you, Council Member Juarez, for those questions. I want to thank Council Member Strauss for bringing this forward designed to support small businesses, which I think there&#39;s a lot of common ground here on the Council for wanting to do that. And I&#39;m supportive of measures to ensure the economic health of small businesses, especially our neighborhood business districts. I did a quick read of the Council Bill 120-001, and as I understand it, it does not change the land use or business codes inside of existing business districts, but rather it loosens the regulations in residential zones where most retail business activities are prohibited or limited in some way. So this is liberalizing those for that 12-month period. My questions concern the potential unmitigated impacts on the residential areas, which people living in them now might want to know more about new small businesses and the related conditions popping up like traffic, maybe unintended consequences for the small businesses in the neighborhood business districts that Council Member Juarez mentioned. I see a lot of benefits of the clustering of businesses together in those business districts. They generate foot traffic together, they get customers together, they&#39;re struggling to reopen their storefronts. And I&#39;ve got a lot of my district, University District, Wallingford, Eastlake-Ravenna, Roosevelt-Wedgewood. So I&#39;m just asking for a little grace here as I try to work through my questions. This is a... I read the bill. It&#39;s well-intentioned. I see it as being very innovative. It was introduced on Monday and it was online Friday afternoon, but I was not able to take a look at it over the weekend. And so I need more time to check in with constituents in my district about this. And I&#39;m glad that we are required to have this other meeting two weeks from now. So this is really helpful and it sounds like our central staff, Ketel Freeman, will be doing a memo. So please view these questions as just sort of getting them out there just so Ketel will help address some of them in the memo and they don&#39;t have to be answered now. Does that sound okay? Should I just sort of rattle off some questions? Please, take it away. And I don&#39;t think we&#39;re required to have another meeting in two weeks from now, but it&#39;s a best practice and something I strive to do. Okay. I didn&#39;t know if it was required for GMA or something.
And also our encouragement to start using, calling restaurants directly and picking up and not using third-party carriers so that all the money goes to that existing small business restaurant, not 15% to, you know, the delivery service. And again, I&#39;m gonna let you speak to and let SCI speak to some of the concerns about what they&#39;re already doing and how this makes it any, if this adds onto that, if they can do that. I don&#39;t have a problem with the idea. I understand we&#39;re in COVID and we wanna encourage this and we want small businesses and a lot of small businesses started out of their garage, but people can still start businesses out of their garage. I&#39;m more concerned about what we&#39;re, the four areas where we&#39;re relaxing and its impact to already existing small businesses and the unfair competition it may or may not create. So that&#39;s where all my concerns were. And I think some of them we addressed at the last hearing. And so that&#39;s why I was glad to get Ketel&#39;s memo this time. So I&#39;ll leave it at that. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Juarez. And I took some notes on what you were saying. I was meeting with the Finney Neighborhood Association yesterday, which is, they&#39;re not, they&#39;re kind of like the Chamber of Commerce for Finney Greenwood. They do social services. I mean, they&#39;re just an amazing organization and they were really supportive of making sure that Yonder was able to stay open. And Yonder is only about a block or two off of their official business district. So right in their own backyard, they&#39;ve got the support of their local business district. And then I wanted to talk about the permanency. And the reason that we have a work plan for the pathway to permanency within the bill is because so many times of late, we&#39;ve heard critics of our work here at City Council saying, you didn&#39;t give us enough time to engage or you didn&#39;t, we didn&#39;t know how to engage. And so rather than have a scattershot approach to understanding what is working well, what didn&#39;t work, did we miss something important or did we include something that shouldn&#39;t have been? That&#39;s why it was important for us to create that work plan from go so that everyone knew where and how they can participate. Regarding parking, yeah, go for it. No, go, I&#39;m finished. I&#39;m sorry, go ahead. Oh, yeah. All right, I&#39;m taking notes, go ahead. So, again, regarding parking, as you said, many different areas of our city have different parking impacts. And so, as well as it&#39;s never exactly clear what different variable in the area is increasing the parking, increasing demand on parking, because we&#39;ve got people who live in homes using it. Again, in Yonder&#39;s case, they&#39;re just a block or two off of the business district. And so, is parking increasing because people are shopping at Yonder or is it because they&#39;re shopping in the business district? That&#39;s why it&#39;s important for me to just create clarity on something that can be subjective. Council Member Juarez, did you wanna share other thoughts? Well, the other thing is I really like this idea because I think what we&#39;re creating here by using garages and driveways, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve ever used the word when you talk about pathways to permanency, is you&#39;re creating like mini incubators for micro businesses and that&#39;s a good thing. I don&#39;t, that&#39;s not, you know, that&#39;s a great thing. I don&#39;t think you need a recession fuel pandemic to do this. We could do it anyway and we should do it and we should encourage it. Again, my main focus is what its impact is to third party struggle, or my impact is to small businesses that are already struggling and creating an unfair advantage because they are struggling from the pandemic. And so, my idea when we have legislation that&#39;s based because we&#39;re in the middle of a recession and pandemic is because it&#39;s a, they&#39;re directly impacted by that, whether it&#39;s the moratorium on renting, housing, all the things that we&#39;ve done. So, we could have done this in a non-pandemic era. We&#39;ve created spaces for incubation for businesses. So, it is innovative in that sense that, yes, you wanna give people that opportunity. And like with Yonder Cider, I think they now have a permanent space. So, if this is a pathway to permanency where they move from garage to a storefront and to a small business, it&#39;s great. It makes sense, that makes sense to me. So, thank you. That&#39;s exactly right, Council Member Juarez. And this, you know, and what I didn&#39;t realize is that these code restrictions were actually creating an unlevel playing field for some of these home occupancy businesses in my neighborhood that have been operating for years. And it wasn&#39;t until Yonder had received this complaint that it opened my eyes to seeing how so many different businesses are operating outside of that letter of the code. And that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to, you know, for the ones that were existing before the pandemic to create that level playing field. And I don&#39;t wanna tattle on them today. No, and to be fair, when we do live in D5 and a lot of businesses, I know of half a dozen businesses that operate out of their homes that I don&#39;t wanna tattle on that make pies and deliver them and do other things and deliver them to certain restaurants. And, you know, it&#39;s just, I get it. So, you wanna legitimize that. You wanna have these kinds of small business incubation, a pathway to permanency to that storefront someday. And so, I want that year. I wanna see what that happens. But again, you see where my concern is when I have constituents who are struggling as small businesses because of this pandemic field recession. So, I&#39;ll leave it at that and let other people speak. Thank you. All right, thanks Council Member Juarez. And if you&#39;ve got more questions later, I always love them. They&#39;re always so spot on. I see Council President, who&#39;s joining us as a guest, as a co-sponsor, and then also Council Member Mosqueda, who co-sponsored. If you&#39;d like to speak after that. Council President, welcome. Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you so much, Chair Strauss. I&#39;m intrigued by this conversation around unfair competition. So, my line of questions are gonna focus around that concept. And perhaps the memo is missing a sort of a comparison chart that might&#39;ve been helpful to the ability to understand the argument around unfair competition between existing brick and mortar small businesses and home-based businesses, which again, are already legal. They already exist in the same ecosystem as brick and mortar small businesses in our commercial district. So, I suppose what my question is about is when we look at what this bill does, we know that Council Bill 120001 relaxes the limitations on, first thing, the number of employees that can be in the home-based business. Ketel, or anybody, Director Torgelsen, Director Assefa, can you let us know whether existing brick and mortar small businesses and commercial districts have a restriction as to the number of employees? I can answer that. To my knowledge, there&#39;s no restriction on the number of employees that can be in a commercially leased space. There may be some restriction that is imposed by the landlord or something like that, but there is not a restriction on the number of employees that can be in the home-based space. And there may also be a code, and there are some code limitations on the occupancy of a space, depending on how large it is, but there&#39;s not an employee-specific limitation. And then, Council President, I&#39;ll add on to that, is that all of these businesses still have to abide by public health guidelines. And so, if the space is not large enough for that number of employees, then that&#39;s a consideration that they... That the land use code is the bottom layer of all of these staffed regulations, regulatory bodies, and licenses. Correct, so there are occupancy limits largely fueled by other public health considerations, but what I&#39;m focusing in on is the... I&#39;m trying to compare and contrast where the unfair competition may exist or may not exist. And so, I am not aware of brick and mortar small businesses who have a commercial lease having the number of employees limited by virtue of having that commercial lease relationship and being in a brick and mortar building, unlike home-based businesses, which do have that restriction of the number of employees they are legally permitted to have in a home-based business. So, that was my first question. My second question is, similarly, as it relates to brick and mortar small businesses and commercial districts that have a commercial lease, are they restricted in terms of the type of customer visits that they&#39;re allowed to receive as compared to home-based businesses, which are currently restricted in terms of the type of customer visits? Not to my knowledge. So, I mean, if you walk up businesses in a neighborhood commercial district can be visited by any number of customers while they&#39;re open. There is a limitation currently in the code. This is what Council President Gonzalez is highlighting that currently in the code, if you want to visit a home-based business, you cannot walk up to that home-based business. You have to have an appointment and gain access that way. That is a distinction, of course, between a home occupation and a commercial business. And again, the last two. Go ahead, Nathan. Director Torvaldson, did you want to add something? No, I&#39;m agreeing with what Ketel said. He&#39;s correct. Okay. And then the last two things that this bill does is increased traffic and parking demand loosens up those restrictions and the non-commercial appearance of home occupations, which I don&#39;t think fairly applies to commercial businesses. But as it relates to increased traffic and parking demand, are there any sort of regulations or restrictions that currently apply to brick-and-mortar small businesses and commercial districts that have a commercial lease that require some compliance or evaluation of how their specific business increases traffic and parking demand in their geographic area? I think the answer to that is not really there. I mean, depending on a use that may be going into a space, it may require review pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act, which has sort of a traffic analysis component to it. But that would have to be a pretty big change. Sort of a limitation that exists in the code at kind of a higher level is a limitation on types of uses. So, you know, depending on the scale of a neighborhood business district, there may or may not be uses that are big traffic generators. That&#39;s at sort of a higher level. It is not necessarily related to the traffic impacts associated with a particular use. It may be other, maybe sort of incorporate other aspects of a use as well. Like for instance, you know, a Starbucks with a drive-through, that&#39;s a use that&#39;s only permitted in certain zones on drive-through businesses. So there are ways in which traffic is limited by the zoning code, but for most business owners who are signing a lease on a small commercial space, like on Fenny Ridge or something like that, those types of regulations are not gonna apply to them. Great. And then, and again, you know, I think as it relates to the unfair competition concerns, you know, I think if there are additional questions around doing sort of a back to the basics, you know, policy, policy comparison between the regulatory framework of what applies to home occupations and what applies to small business districts Might have been a little more helpful in terms of evaluating whether or not there is true unfair competition that would be created by this council bill. I&#39;ll say that just based on this line of questioning and your answers to me, that it seems that the unfair competition currently exists and that it exists and that that bias exists against home-based businesses and not brick and mortar small businesses that engage in commercial leasing of space that are regulated by the land use code. And so for me, this bill is an opportunity to address unfair competition that currently exists against home-based businesses that are much more stringently regulated and that&#39;s true whether we&#39;re in a pandemic or not, that regulation exists whether we&#39;re in a pandemic or not. And so the question is, is knowing that commercial lease spaces are becoming increasingly unaffordable, knowing that commercial lease spaces are increasing in terms of number of vacancies and future availability of those spaces, I think this is a unique moment in our efforts to revitalize neighborhoods and to invest in our local economy to begin the process now of creating a pathway from garages to brick and mortar commercial lease spaces that might not otherwise be available. That pathway might not otherwise be available for many of these small home-based businesses that we are hoping this bill will help. And the last thing I wanna address is that the issue of permanency and interim nature of this legislation. Maybe we can talk a little bit more in granular detail about what we mean when we say that we&#39;re exploring a potential to make these less restrictive regulations permanent. And so I think we could all benefit from just hearing a little bit more about what that process, what legally we would be required in order to do before this council could even begin a conversation around creating permanency as opposed to the legislation just applying during the pandemic. Sure, yeah, thank you for that question, Council President Gonzalez. So the term of this ordinance is one year and there is an aspect of that which is kind of based on the mechanics of the authority under state law that the bill would be enacted under. So the bill is being enacted under authority provided by RCW 3678-390, which allows local jurisdictions to set up interim development controls, so things that don&#39;t last forever. And those interim development controls come with two time periods. One is a year and the other is six months. If a jurisdiction wants interim controls to last up to a year, there must be a work program. So there must be a pathway towards considering more permanent regulation. So that is one of the reasons why there is a work program contained in this bill so that the council will have the benefit of STCI&#39;s work about a year from now. And also so that the changes will last a year. A lot of the questions that you&#39;re raising are excellent questions and ones that could be answered about a year from now with some work probably by the Office of Economic Development and STCI. There are a few kind of logical ways this could all play out. After a year, the STCI could recommend that we make no changes. The city actually has relatively permissive home occupation regulations compared to most other jurisdictions. So that&#39;s one of the reasons why we&#39;re asking for a year from now. The other reason is that we don&#39;t have a permit for home occupations in other jurisdictions. So we could decide, the city could decide, STCI could decide and propose to the council that nothing changed. In which case, after a year, the ordinance expires and all of the changes in the ordinance go away. It could be the case that STCI recommends that there be a change to how we regulate home occupations or a land-use permit for home occupations other jurisdictions do. They set a land-use permit requirement based on some sort of threshold about the size of a business and what kind of impacts that business may have. So it may be the case that STCI recommends to the council that we begin to require permits for certain types of home occupations that are above a certain size threshold or perhaps close to neighborhood business districts. We have some experience with this in a kind of in a street use context. A few years ago, the city modified regulations for food trucks. And one of the requirements that is built into those regulations is that those food trucks can&#39;t be parked on the same block face as an existing restaurant. So some kind of requirement like that could be built into some proposal in the future from STCI. So those are some, with the benefit of future analysis, there&#39;ll be some policy choices here for the council to make about whether and how to modify our home occupations on a permanent basis to address, sort of balance the competing concerns with incubation of small businesses and a level playing field with those businesses that are occupying spaces in our neighborhood commercial districts. Yeah, so in, you know, one of the things that I&#39;ll be honest, I get frustrated about is the city&#39;s tendency to engage in short-term pilot projects and pilot projects that are, you know, designed to be two months or three months or four months. And frankly, I think it takes much longer period of testing an innovative new model in order to truly change or understand human adaptation and behavior to those modifications. This is something that when I went to Copenhagen a few years ago, it feels like ages ago at this point, one of the things that they talked about in terms of how we transform the public realm for safe, healthy public use is that pilot projects can&#39;t just be, you know, two or three months, that the best practice, the best standard is to strive to have a pilot project that would last up to a year to truly allow people who are used to using a particular space in a particular way since the beginning of time, an opportunity to have a more meaningful engagement with how the use of a space has changed and modified. And that kind of, you know, effort really yields to better policy because it&#39;s much more thoughtful, much more engaging, and much more accurately reflective of the sentiment of people who ordinarily use that space. So for me, I see this interim use as an opportunity for us to collect, actively, proactively collect that data that could then be utilized in addition to the work plan information to really get a good sense of where the playing field may not be currently level and how this legislation can be shaped in the future to promote a pathway for micro enterprises into commercial space without creating, you know, unnecessary competition. So I&#39;m excited about this legislation for a lot of reasons, but I think it&#39;s a good opportunity for a lot of reasons, but I appreciate the opportunity to engage in that line of questioning as an alternate guest of this committee. So thank you, Chair Strauss. I&#39;m gonna sit here quietly now until right before you call this for a vote. Thank you, Council President, and great to have you listed as a co-sponsor in all of your work. And I know VWIN and your office has been helping out as well. So much appreciation to you and your point is well taken that policy really does require four years of implementation to come into full effect. And I know that you went to Copenhagen in the 20-teens. It feels about the 20-teens seem like a decade ago already, but here we are 2021. Council Vice Chair Mosqueda, also a co-sponsor on the bill. And then Council Member Peterson, is your hand raised from earlier or is that new? That&#39;s new, thanks. Great, so we&#39;ll hear from Vice Chair Mosqueda, Council Member Peterson. Take it away, Vice Chair. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I appreciate being here. Thank you very much for allowing me to be a co-sponsor with you and the Council President. I&#39;m very excited for this legislation in front of us today. I appreciate the amendment that you&#39;ve included here. I just do have a few summary thoughts about why I think it&#39;s important for us to move forward on this legislation and some comments as well regarding the issues around parking, and I would say also the ongoing conversation around whether or not this is going to be any form of unfair advantage for other entrepreneurs across our city. So first, let me say thank you so much during this pandemic especially, I think it&#39;s important for us to recognize that COVID has absolutely turned our economy upside down. Our daily life patterns, our routines, nothing is like it was before. And the current rules for small businesses make it absolutely difficult for folks to respond quickly and to try to create economic stability for their community, for their family, if they&#39;re not able to potentially open a small business if they have the ability to do that in their home. I think that this is a really important tool for us to be able to advance during this pandemic and then to absolutely look at its potential benefits for a longer term nature to make sure that our city can respond more quickly as local entrepreneurs want to open businesses across the city. And no, this isn&#39;t business as usual because frankly, business as usual in the city has made it very hard sometimes for small businesses to open. So I&#39;m excited about the opportunity that&#39;s been provided by this. And I think this is a citywide benefit as we think about the number of people who could potentially benefit from this type of ordinance. We also know that especially immigrants and people of color are also less willing to sort of push the envelope and keep asking for change. And I really applaud Yonderbar for putting this issue on our radar. And as the sponsors have noted repeatedly, this is about the entire city and actually looking at about the entire benefit across the fabric of our communities to try to make it easier for small businesses to open and stay open. Coronavirus has laid bare our inequities in many ways by creating barriers to being able to access true economic stability. And I think by suspending some of these rules, we&#39;re recognizing that our local community, our entrepreneurs, these shops are doing everything that they can to make it through these very challenging times. I&#39;m excited to be a sponsor of this interim policy. And I do hope that we continue to look for ways to make this part of our longer term solution, to make our communities more resilient, to make them more walkable, to make them more sustainable, and as we think about opening up more small business shops across the city, I also know that it has to be coupled with more housing, more housing opportunities. We want this to be a walkable, livable, economically viable city for everyone who lives here. And a lot of that means making sure that there are front stores like the ones that we&#39;re talking about today, more access to childcare, more street cafes and multifamily structures across the city. I do wanna address some of the questions that came up with sort of my own perspective about why I&#39;m supporting this legislation. I would say that the existing code doesn&#39;t actually work for encouraging entrepreneurs. So for example, council member Juarez, I know before I wasn&#39;t in the committee, but talked about a fry bread shop. I&#39;ve been talking about Tasty Tacos, which is my grandparents&#39; restaurant that they own. If we wanted to create a Tasty Tacos or a fry bread shop in our front yards through our garages, it would make absolutely no sense to do it by appointment only. It would make no sense to have no sign out there. It would not even be feasible to do this with just two people that don&#39;t work in, that are not part of our families. And those are just not requirements that work for encouraging entrepreneurs. It&#39;s also, I think important for us to look for ways to address that fourth pillar, which is how do we make sure that there is not traffic congestion? That&#39;s something I actually support. And by some of the amendments that we&#39;re making today, we&#39;re encouraging foot traffic, we&#39;re encouraging visibility from the street. I do wanna talk about the concerns that have come up about the parking requirements. And I&#39;m gonna refer to page 27 from this report, which some of you have probably already read. It&#39;s called A Better City from 2016, Future of Parking in Boston. It looks at parking and entrepreneur opportunities across the city. And they did a cross city comparison. I&#39;m gonna cite New York. I&#39;m gonna cite Portland. And a few other cities where they looked at curb space, because obviously people think, hey, the curb space right in front of your business is the most viable thing to protect, but it&#39;s actually sort of counterintuitive to promoting what small businesses want. And that&#39;s additional traffic in their stores, foot traffic and additional revenue. The curbside space is actually the most valuable space given its proximity to the business, but not for the reasons that you might think. It&#39;s not just about having that spot and getting out of your car and jumping into the shop as soon as possible. It actually, the report showed that the curb, when it is occupied by parked cars, actually conflicts with pedestrians who want to be able to walk around and see what&#39;s in the neighborhood. It conflicts with bicycle and bicycle parking and the visibility of the small business from the street. So in Portland, Oregon, when they reallocated or removed on-site street parking from right in front of the shops, they saw that the commercial areas, those small commercial shops actually had greater room for bike corrals and greater visibility from the street. And a preliminary survey of adjacent businesses around the area also showed that there was a 52% increase in the business&#39;s viability from the street and a 67% increase for foot traffic and bike traffic, all of which contributes to increased business activity and revenue. That&#39;s from the report. And then furthermore, when looking at Brooklyn, New York, and they looked at the number of unused, underutilized parking spots in Brooklyn, and they converted those areas to things like public event areas, and removed the parking requirements, there was an increase in visibility to the small businesses and saw 172% increase in retail sales at locally created businesses. This is about supporting those small businesses, especially as we think about what&#39;s happening right now. I&#39;ve talked about this before. I am not driving across the city like we used to, but I am walking way more in my neighborhood than I used to. I&#39;m walking to those local small businesses. And as we think about folks coming out of their home and engaging more in their communities, I want more people to walk around their neighborhoods, but I also want them to walk around other economic hubs across the city. I think that this is actually a way for us to continue to increase visibility from the street and improve walkability and bikeability, and also to improve the economic viability of those small businesses. We are doing some of the things that the study talks about, right? We started some of these things before COVID. We had been working on creating more parking vacations in some of these spots that were usually used just for one car parking, and we&#39;ve converted many of those spaces across the city pre-COVID into parking for bikes, for example. But now look what we&#39;ve done during COVID. We&#39;ve turned a number of these parking spots into actual outside eateries, which is good during COVID time, but as the report noted, which was pre-COVID, it&#39;s actually good for the businesses to be able to have that outside parking or that outside dining area to begin with. I think that this piece of legislation will be very similar, and we will continue to see that by making more small businesses be able to open in small, in neighborhoods that don&#39;t actually have access to these types of small entrepreneurial opportunities right now. We&#39;re gonna continue to see greater foot traffic. Those small businesses are gonna see more people walking around the neighborhood, and the businesses that already exist will potentially see more patrons, more foot traffic, more people engaging, coming in to browse the stores, and more purchases ultimately. I think it&#39;s a really great way for us to make sure that we&#39;re engaging across the city, creating more economic local hubs throughout our neighborhoods, and I think it&#39;s an economic stimulant for Seattle that I do hope the data will show that this will be a way for us in the longterm to encourage more entrepreneurs across our city. And finally, from the equity perspective, every single report talks about the fact that the COVID-induced recession has disproportionately affected women and people of color in terms of lost jobs, lost hours, and lost livelihood. And if we want to think about how we create a more equitable recovery in the long run, we have to be thinking about ways that we allow for people to use their entrepreneurial spirit, those tools at their disposal, and to be able to allow them to open up new shops.
You know, food security. And, and. You know, not just. You know, hunger. But like children&#39;s education. And. No space for. For all kinds of folks. Marginalized folks to be able to. And to get in touch with food and land. So as far as the covenant goes, I think. We&#39;re moving the covenant. The way that that will. Be more flexibility for. How this land. And be managed and. What kinds of transfers can happen. This is just like nine mentioned as long as. Nurturing roots is prioritized in. Helping move that process forward. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Okay. Next we have Isaac joy listed. Isaac. Are you on. Either Isaac. The caller has left. Okay. Okay. Naima Clark. Thank you. Yes. Thank you. My name is Naima. With nurturing roots. I&#39;m calling in support of the covenant being transferred to a new landscape in South Seattle. I want the record to show that this covenant transfer was initiated by thousands of comments, but I do want to make a couple of points. One is that. I&#39;ve spoken to a lot of people who have access. The red barn ranch parcel. I&#39;ve spoken to a lot of. County. I&#39;ve spoken to parks and rec. And the parks department seems very adamant about. Finding a way to get community on that land. And one step was this covenant. I&#39;m not sure how this is going to benefit the community. But how will it benefit the community that actually started this movement? I just want to lift up all the voices that have triggered this. And I hope that a lot of county. Excuse me. A lot of city officials, both county and in parks will identify why this was triggered. And again, in favor of moving the covenant. Okay. Next. Next is David Haynes. Is that the updated signup sheet? That&#39;s correct. Okay. David Haynes is not here. Okay. Next is Trayana holiday. Don&#39;t forget to press star six. Hi everyone. This is Trayana holiday. And I just wanted to say that I fully support. The idea of transforming this into red barn ranch. I echo. So much, all of my emails comments in regard to how we need to have a community approach towards food stability, food, sustainability and nurturing roots has proven. To me, it&#39;s not just a matter of having a community approach to food sustainability. It&#39;s a matter of having a community approach to food sustainability. To help bring a multitude of services and resources. To this space. And so I fully support. Uplifting this restrictive covenant that unfortunately means that there&#39;s some type of. Layers of bureaucracy that nurturing roots would have to go through in order for them to even get this property. And so I, I do believe that this is a time for us to be, to be proactive in this. In this conversation. That means that means a direct impact. For black community. And when we talk about it being in your hand, this is one action you guys can take. As a collective council to say, you know what? We understand the need for this in community and we obliged that need. Because we do have to find innovative ways to move forward from so many different ways. And so I&#39;m in full agreement with, with leaving that old covenant behind and moving forward in an innovative way. And Seattle taking the opportunity to lead and show the rest of the nation. How we get things done. Thank you. Next is Rachel. Her life. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes. Rachel, go ahead. Hi, my name is Rachel. I was born in and I live in district five in Seattle. And I just want to echo Naima&#39;s comments. I think that removing this covenant, removing this covenant from red barn ranch is a great next step. Towards transferring this property to the community. I&#39;m an urban farmer in Seattle. And I think the more farms we can get to improve Seattle food sovereignty. And. Food security. The better. So fully in support. Thank you. Next we have. Lajaya Washington. Listed. But it&#39;s not present. I just want to confirm that. Okay, next we have. We have. Emijah Smith. Listed, but not present. And then we have Alexander place signed up. But it&#39;s not present. And then the last person signed up. Is Karen Tor. Touring. And is listed present Karen. Are you on. Yes, I&#39;m here. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Karen, go ahead. Thank you. I just want to confirm that we are considering. Removing this restrictive covenant. So that the community can. Put that red barn ranch property to the best and highest use. I support the previous speakers. I have been in community with those speakers. I know the work of nurturing roots and the black farmers collective. I believe that they are ideal candidates. And I believe that this is the best way to activate an inactive space. And I am in full support. Of removing this restrictive covenant. One other thing that I would like to add is that the agenda that was published for this particular meeting had only one item. So I would ask the council staff, the committee staff to. You know, if there are four items on the agenda. I would like to ask the council staff to consider. And I support and approve this work. I think it is the right way for the council to go. And I would hope that future. Bureaucracy related to the transfer of this land to nurturing roots and the black farmers collective, the expedited. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That is the end of our list. Council member. Okay, great. So we&#39;ll need to close. As well. Okay. We have one just came in. Okay. We have another caller. Someone else for public comment on the red barn ranch. Okay. Thank you, Timmy. And I apologize if I&#39;m butchering your name. Are you available? Hello. Yes, we see her. Go ahead. Yes, we can&#39;t go ahead. Hi, I&#39;m here. Please speak. In regards to the red bar ranch. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry. I just want to say that I completely agree with removing their strictest covenant. The work that red bar ranch has done so far in our community has been life-changing. It&#39;s been inspiring. And for land to be not in use. This is a perfect opportunity for the city to do something forward in the community and put it to use through the red bar ranch. And I just want to say that, you know, I think that this is the most important project. That we consider. So, yeah, that&#39;s all I wanted to say. Thank you very much, Timmy for calling in. Are we any more colors? Okay. I believe we&#39;re done. Okay. So at this point, we are going to officially close our comments for the public hearing, which was item number four on the red barn ranch. And I would like to invite our presenters and I ask everyone to introduce themselves. For the record before beginning, but I want to make a few comments. Superintendent. A gallery is here and he has a eight page PowerPoint that is going to walk us through. What we&#39;re going to do today regarding the red barn ranch and the North rain near land bank property. So we are removing, we are, we are working today to look at removing the recreational covenant from the red barn ranch. Which is a ranch located outside of Auburn, not in the city limits. It&#39;s about 39 acres. And we&#39;re also looking at placing a restrictive covenant on the North rain near land bank site. And we&#39;re also looking at placing a restrictive covenant on the North rain near land bank site. Which in the future will be a new neighborhood park in the South end. So with that, I&#39;m going to hand it off to the superintendent and you can make introductions and we will go through your PowerPoint. So. Go ahead. It&#39;s yours. Thank you, chair. And superintendent of Seattle parks and recreation. And we&#39;ve got several folks. From parks and recreation here for the various presentations. So I&#39;m going to hand it over to the superintendent. And then we&#39;ll go through the others. Okay. We&#39;ll introduce the others as we go along. So Selena, why don&#39;t we kick it off with you? Everyone&#39;s Selena Elmer on the SPR policy team. Good afternoon council members, Max Jacobs with Seattle parks and recreation, real estate. Thank you. And I think the game was going to share the presentation as we jump into it. Yes. One moment. Okay. Look, I&#39;m looking at the history on this. Hey, Sue. So this looks like the city bought this way back in 1970. That&#39;s correct. Yep. 40 Years. Yep. Okay. Are we ready? Okay. See the screen. Yep. Yep. Okay. Well, thank you again. Thank you. I just want to absolutely acknowledge and express my appreciation for all the folks. Who came to testify today, but also all the folks who have been advocating on behalf of. A new use for this property, particularly at individuals from nurturing roots. Some folks from King county equity now. And really appreciate the advocacy that they&#39;re sharing in terms of how we can, how we can, how we can, how we can be more inclusive and how we can, how we can be more inclusive and how we can, how we can explore different possibilities for the site and really think about creative uses for this underutilized land. We appreciate that very much. And, and as you said, The idea here obviously is, is procedural to some extent. To, to clear the way so that we can begin to do some, some more creative thinking and the next steps for this property have been, have been a long time coming. So, so thank you for, for, for, for all your support. I appreciate it. And I think we can go to the next slide. Just to, to give folks a little bit of. Geographic awareness here as customer has you stated, this is a property that&#39;s just under 40 acres, 39 acres, excuse me. That is south east of Seattle near Auburn. And so it&#39;s a pretty big piece of property. It&#39;s a pretty big piece of property. And you can see on the, on the left, on the right, it sort of shows you the layout of the site. It&#39;s got some, you can see sort of that white square. There&#39;s some structures in the top left. And then there&#39;s some forested land and some, some wetland areas to the right and then to the south. So it&#39;s a pretty big piece of property has a lot going on there, but largely it&#39;s it&#39;s open space. And we&#39;ve been doing this for a long time. We&#39;ve been doing this for a long time. We purchased this property back in 1970. And that&#39;s part of the reason why we&#39;re here today, because the way in which the city acquired this property was utilizing funding from the recreation conservation office. Whenever we purchase land and we do that to this date. Well, whenever we purchase land with funding from recreation, conservation office. We have to have a restrictive covenants. Covenants on the property that&#39;s being purchased and those restrictive covenants require us to keep the land in use for parks and recreation and continue to provide. Public access. So, you know, historically again, this property has been with us for, for many, many years has been used in various different ways. As you can see here by the history. Most recently in the two thousands. Seattle tilth has been in, had been in on the property along with camp Baraka. And then in 2014 to 2018, Seattle tilth was there on their own and then they vacated the property back in 2018. Since Seattle tilth left, we began at parks and recreation, a process to try to understand and identify what we could do with this property. Some very practical and pragmatic challenges for us are where the property is and how much work it requires for maintenance and supervision, et cetera. So we pretty quickly realized we wanted to dispose of the property. And so we began a process of trying to identify what we could do with the property. And thus began the conversations with the recreation conservation office. About what we could do with the property. And those conversations started way back in 2019, as I said, once, once. The property has been vacant since then. Next slide, please. And just a quick overview again, as I said, this recreation restrictive covenant comes with the funding source. And that&#39;s what we&#39;re asking for. And that&#39;s what we&#39;re asking for. In order for us to do anything differently with this property, we would need to remove the covenant and that&#39;s what we&#39;re here asking for your approval. Which, which again, This would limit us if we don&#39;t leave, if we don&#39;t remove these covenants, then the, the, what we can do on this property is, is pretty limited. So again, Without it we wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything differently. So. And that&#39;s what we&#39;re asking for. And that&#39;s what we&#39;re asking for. And that&#39;s what we&#39;re asking for. And then another step as part of this process will be. To take a look at initiative 42, which for council members, you should know for members of the public initiative 42 is an initiative. That requires any property that&#39;s within the parks and recreation portfolio to be utilized for parks and recreation uses. There&#39;s lots of reasons why, and obviously we&#39;ll get into that more deeply when we come back to you with this, but there&#39;s lots of reasons why we believe initiative 42. Really doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t work. With the property that&#39;s 30 miles outside of the city of Seattle. So we expect to be coming back to you all to, to, to address that and, and, and likely would need to just. Move forward with, with, with setting aside initiative 42 with regards to this. So, but more to come on that. That&#39;s, that&#39;s a great. Today&#39;s just about the RCO. Next slide, please. And so part of the process to remove this covenants was first getting approval from the recreation conservation offices. And I said, we started this back in 2019. More recently in January, we were able to get approval from the RCO board to remove those, those covenants, but in order to remove them, we have to put them somewhere else. And that&#39;s why we have a piece of property that has not yet been developed. And we have very few of those that qualify for this. And so. The North Rainier property is really the only one that&#39;s a good target. We have one other that is on Lake union, but that already has been, has been identified as a place to transfer some other covenants that we&#39;re working as part of another pro another project. So the other reason why this property, the, the, the North rainier site makes sense is it&#39;s a site that we&#39;re already seeking our additional RCO money for recreation conservation office money for. So there will be covenants on that property anyway. So this is really a great opportunity for us to take advantage of that. So again, today we&#39;re going to ask you to release the existing recreational deeds from the bread barn branch property. We&#39;re asking them to record new, a new deed. Covenant on the North rainier property. Which again allows us to, it doesn&#39;t intervene with our current plans for that property. In fact, it allows us to move forward. The timing on this is important. As I, as I mentioned, In order to remove to transfer the covenants to a new property, that property can&#39;t yet be developed. The North marineer property is actually one of our land banks. I said is moving forward. And again, pending some receipt of grants. We&#39;re planning to move forward that development this summer, as early as July. So we&#39;d like to move these covenants over if we&#39;re able to do it. So then, then we don&#39;t slow that down. Next slide, please. Sorry to back up just a tiny bit, just to, to show folks where the North rainier property is. It&#39;s an, excuse me, Southeast Seattle. This is a series of. Kind of land acquisitions we&#39;ve made to pull together this property, which is a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, A. I&#39;m Sorry. That&#39;s One acre, right? It&#39;s Just under an acre. Yeah. Yeah. That&#39;s Correct. Next Slide, please. And Then as, as we&#39;ve been stated several times here, this is just the first step in order to create some flexibility for us to do something different and creative. And So we&#39;re, we&#39;re working with a consultant to figure out what needs to happen to the property for, for future use. Now, Obviously in order to figure out what needs to be done, we have to have a better sense of what the future uses. So, So there&#39;s still some work to be done there. But Ultimately we, we, we imagine, or we actually, we would plan on designing and implementing this sort of community development plan. And So we&#39;re, we&#39;re working with a consultant to figure out what needs to happen to the property in order to support that specific long-term use, whether it&#39;s one organization or several organizations. Still Have, have to do some restoration on the site. Again, Figure out what we as a, as a city need to do to the property to be able to move forward. And Then there&#39;s, there&#39;s several aspects of further legal analysis that have to be done. I Mentioned initiative 42. There Are also some questions around if we&#39;re going to invest further in the city of Seattle, if we&#39;re going to invest in the city of Seattle. And Then there&#39;s also the resources from the park district, for example, can we spend part of district money outside of the city? Seattle. So, So some legal analysis and legal work. It Still has to happen. As We work through this, but again, this is the first step that we&#39;re asking for today. And I guess on the last slide I hear I have here. And Again, if you don&#39;t mind, again, just asking you all to help us transfer this recreation covenant from red barn ranch to North Rainier site. I&#39;m Not sure if we can get it on the screen. But I&#39;m going to ask you all to help us transfer this recreation covenant from red barn ranch to North Rainier site. And Again, it allows the timing of this allows us to continue the development of the North Rainier site. And Those are the slides on this item. I&#39;m Happy to take any questions and Selena and Max can chime in and help out with any questions. If I don&#39;t have the answer. First, Let me just add, thank you for the PowerPoint superintendent. And Also we had, I had a chance to go through the summary and the fiscal note. And We had a chance to go through the budget. And We had a chance to go through the budget. And We had a chance to go through the budget. And I&#39;m just curious about the use of this. And Advocates for the use of this property in the future. So I know that you would. Like We, your PowerPoint had showed the city had bought this in 1970. And Now this is just another technical piece of. Removing That covenant. And Then of course, placing a restrictive covenant for you can land for the North. The Rainier property. Thank You. Thank You. Any Other questions. Anyone Else from. My Colleagues. Or Anyone else that wants to share any information. Or Ask any questions. Of The superintendent or Selena or Max. Okay. Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Casper Herbal. Please. One Of the things I heard folks speak to in the public hearing is a Reflection on the public record. I Think in, in what I was hearing was. Sort Of. A Reflection, not just in the public record in their testimony, but. In Our actions that we&#39;re taking. About The interest in transferring the property to nurturing roots. And specifically supporting the vision for creating a space for black. Farming A healing space and youth empowerment on the property. Thank You. I Really appreciate the work that. The Leaders have been doing and nurturing roots. And Meeting with the leadership at parks and recreation regularly since last year. We&#39;ve Received hundreds. Maybe Thousands of emails, encouraging this transfer. And I&#39;m just wondering. If There&#39;s anything that you would like to add to that? I Would like to add that. I Would like to see a little bit of action, maybe with, with recital or something. Just In order to. You Know, to, to respect and honor the engagement and. And Efforts of, of community members to, to. And Their work really to have brought us as far as we have. I Would like to add, I would like to add that we have a long public process with the superintendent. Because Today it&#39;s just technically just to legally, just to remove the covenant. I Assume from the PowerPoint and my discussions with the superintendent. We Have a long public process ahead of us and we can certainly entertain resolutions. A Council member herbal, this committee can. Honoring And voicing the concerns and the interest. Of The group. And You&#39;re right. We Have a long public process ahead of us. And We have a long public process ahead of us. From The nurturing roots organization and from the other, other folks. So. But I should be, you know, candor. There&#39;s Some other groups that are interested in this property as well, including some tribes. So I guess with that, that&#39;s why we have this right now. This Is just the first step, just get rid of the covenant. Okay. So We&#39;re going to start the process about. Again, With the whole public process, with the person that. Hey, Susan, I&#39;m hired. You Guys hired the. You Guys hired a third party to come in to advise you. And Then we&#39;ll start the public process there. And I think there will be a plenty of opportunity. For Us to entertain resolutions for particular groups. And I think that&#39;s why we&#39;re being very clear about it. Right Now, it&#39;s just lifting the covenant so we can move forward. Is There anything that you want to add superintendent? No, Thank you. I Would just want to clarify the, the consultant we&#39;ve engaged in is only on the physical property itself in terms of, of what work needs to be done. And We&#39;ve not begun discussions with any consultant about a future use. And We have had lots of discussions internally with other agencies. To Help us understand again, but the, the legal hurdles as well as opportunities for a community visioning process that would then get us to start asking those, those next series of questions that you mentioned. So, So when will the consultant be able to get back to us, this committee? We&#39;ll Just put, tell us exactly what, what is the deliverable from your consultant? Sure. So, So we&#39;ve, we&#39;ve had one consultant that engaged and looked at the existing buildings to give us some information about what it. What&#39;s What&#39;s what useful life is left in any of these buildings. Some Of them. They&#39;re Clearly recommending to be demolished that there are others that, that could be usable with significant investment. The Challenge we have though, council member is that we have that data. We Need another round, but that second round of, of. Information Really is, is dependent on what we anticipate the next use to be. So We sort of have to do it. We Have to do these two things together. So As we identify a process to understand what the, the, the next and long-term uses property is, then we will bring on the consultant to help us as we get to that, to that answer. So, So I don&#39;t have a deliverable anymore. Beyond What we currently have, which is a report in hand that again gives us some various facilities, specific items to do. And That was really, if we have this property ourselves, what would need to happen to, to make it safe? And Just Viable to, to keep the property going. So. Right. And We&#39;ve had these, we&#39;ve had a lot of issues with flooding on the property. And This, this property has been vacant for three years. So There&#39;s going to be some structural issues, some safety issues, just like we&#39;ve done before. We Had flooding issues on other pieces of property where people just said, why can&#39;t you just give it to us? And We&#39;re like, well, we can&#39;t there&#39;s liability issues. We Have to, you can&#39;t just build housing there. So We&#39;re going to have to come up with a way to, to make it safe for people. And So I appreciate your sentiments. And I know that this was bought in 1970 for a purpose, but I&#39;m guessing it outgrew that purpose. So That&#39;s why right now. And Since it looks like the County didn&#39;t want it. Or That didn&#39;t work out the County King County. So This is why we&#39;re moving forward just to remove the covenant. But I do appreciate, appreciate your sentiments and what you&#39;re trying to establish here. And I just want to make sure that we&#39;re, that we&#39;re clear on that. I Don&#39;t think that we would be discussing. That Predetermined any use of the property. Nearly Recognize that we would not be discussing. Lifting The covenant. If It were not for the interest of the community in this piece of property. I Think there is a nod there at least in that very broad and vague language about the fact that they&#39;re going to look at a potential transfer and other use. But Again, not at the specific level. That Some may have wanted, but perhaps it was predetermined at this point and not, I&#39;m not ready. It Sounds like full discussion and agreement by the council. Okay. Thank You. Are There any other questions or. Colleagues. Council Member Peterson. Thank You chair Morris. This Question is either for parks or central staff. You Might&#39;ve answered this already, but is. Does The state law or the state agreement. When You&#39;re getting rid of the restrictive covenants for recreation. And You&#39;re then transferring those to another property. You&#39;ve Got, We&#39;ve got a 38 acre property here currently, and then you&#39;re transferring it to a property that has. I Think you said about one acre. Is There any sort of equivalency requirement or. Just Sort of make sure we&#39;re. I Think the, the, what, what happens here is we have 40 acres, but it&#39;s in unincorporated. The North Rainier land bank site is much more valuable. So The, the real question here was for us to, that&#39;s part of the question. We Went to the recreation conservation office to ask them. If This was sufficient for them once they agreed to it, then we&#39;re fine. And That&#39;s part of what they consider is whether, whether there&#39;s a, there&#39;s a comparable, So I don&#39;t know if that answers your question or if you, if you wanted a more legal. Yes. Thank You. Thanks. All Right. Yes. Okay. Okay. Thank You. All Right. All Right. Any Other questions or all right. So, So if there are none, there are no further questions. So We can move to vote. In Order for this committee to vote on a final recommendation to the city council, we first need to suspend the council role relating to voting on legislation. On The same day, a public hearing is held, which we had. With That, if there&#39;s no objection, the council will relating to final committee recommendations on legislation on the same day, a public hearing is held is suspended. Hearing No objection. The Council rule is suspended. We Will now proceed with the vote. I Move that the committee recommend passage of council bill one two zero zero four eight. Second. There&#39;s Been a second. Any More comments. All Right. Council Member Herbold. Yes. Council Member Mosqueda. Yes. Council Member Peterson. Yes. Council Member. Yes. Council Member Juarez. Yes. That&#39;s Five in favor. None Opposed. Right. Passes In that will the committee&#39;s action. Okay. Item Number five sale public arms. I&#39;m Sorry. This Is, this is all about parking. CL Parks and rec and sale public school, but go ahead and again, why don&#39;t you read into the record? I Have a number five. I&#39;m Sorry. Council Bell one two zero zero three three.

So I&#39;m guessing we have the same presenters if they get, excuse me, again, for the record, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m Sorry. I&#39;m Sorry. I&#39;m Sorry. I&#39;m Sorry. And Max. Good Afternoon. Council Members again, count Max Jacobs with Seattle parks and recreation, real estate. And
We are recording. Good morning. The May 12, 2021 meeting of the Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee will come to order. It is 9.32 a.m. I am Dan Strauss, chair of the committee. Will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Here. Council Member Lewis? Present. Council Member Juarez? Here. Council Member Mosqueda? Present. Chair Strauss? Present. Five. Present. Thank you. The Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee of the City of Seattle starts with land acknowledgement since we are the Land Use Committee. This is not a checklist, nor should it be a rote behavior. This does not give us a passport or permission to proceed however we desire. This is a reminder that we must steward our work here in this committee as guests, as our time here on the committee, in the government, and alive is short. The Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee of the City of Seattle begins by acknowledging we are on the traditional land and ancestral land of the First People of this region, past and present, represented in a number of tribes and as urban natives, and honor with gratitude the land itself and the people of this land. We start with this acknowledgement to recognize, again, the fact that we are guests and should steward our land as such, as guests. We are on indigenous land and we want it back, so just thought I&#39;d add that. A welcome addition. Thank you, Council Member. We have four items on today&#39;s agenda, a briefing discussion and vote on Council Bill 12068, which extends our street cafe and sidewalk cafe permits for an additional year as currently permitted, a briefing and discussion of a proposed land use overlay to preserve mobile home parks, a briefing discussion and vote on Council Bill 12067, which accepts a grant for Department of Neighborhood Census outreach work, and a briefing and discussion on proposed updates to SDCI&#39;s technical codes. The next meeting of the Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee will be on Wednesday, May 26, starting at 930 a.m. Before we begin, if there is no objection, the agenda will be adopted. Hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted. At this time, we will open the remote public comment period for the items on today&#39;s agenda. Before we begin, I ask that everyone please be patient as we learn to operate this new system in real time. While it remains our strong intent to have public comment regularly included on meeting the City Council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or is unsuitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner in which we are able to conduct our necessary business. I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner. Public comment period for this meeting is up to 10 minutes, and each speaker will be given two minutes to speak. I will call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the Council&#39;s website. If you have not yet registered to speak but would like to, you can sign up before the end of public comment by going to the Council&#39;s website. The public comment link is also listed on today&#39;s agenda. Once I call on a speaker&#39;s name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt if you have been unmuted will be the speaker&#39;s cue that it is their turn to speak. At that point, the speaker must press star six, not pound six, star six. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item in which you are addressing. Once the speaker hears the chime, we ask that you please begin to wrap up your public comments. If speakers do not end their public comments at the end of the allotted time provided, the speaker&#39;s microphone will be muted after 10 seconds to allow us to proceed to the next speaker. Once you have completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line, and if you plan to continue following the meeting, please do so via Seattle Channel or the listening options listed on the agenda. The public comment period is now open, and we will begin with the first speaker on the list. Today, we have three people signed up. We have Ray Dubicki, Gay Gilmore, and Jesse Crossett. All are present. So please, good morning, Ray. You are up first, and hang on just a second. You can press star six. One moment, Ray, and you are free to take it away. Hi, Councilmembers. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Fantastic. My name is Ray Dubicki. I&#39;m a renter in Ballard, and I&#39;m speaking on CB 120068. Councilmembers, thank you for the chance to speak in support of the legislation. I&#39;ve been writing about open streets for the urbanist for about a year now, particularly the ones around Seattle that have been formed up in order to let people social distance during this pandemic. Few have been as successful as the Ballard Avenue open street due to coordination between the city and Ballard Alliance and the businesses on the street. CB 120068 opens the pathway to make this success permanent, and I really encourage the City Council to move ahead with this legislation. One real quick note, the staff&#39;s fiscal note says there is really only one fiscal impact for the proposed legislation, and that is SDOT foregoing any permit fees associated with giving up parking spaces in front of the businesses. I just hope that as this legislation moves forward, SDOT and the city will look at how much money the city will be making from sales tax and salaries and other things from people being able to eat and enjoy restaurants and Ballard Avenue in the new pergolas and things outside. So with that note, I really look forward to making Ballard Avenue&#39;s pergola safe streets permanent and hopefully finding other places around the city to do the same. Thank you very much, Councilmembers. Thank you, Ray. Up next is Gay Gilmore, followed by Jessie Clawson. Hi, my name is Gay Gilmore, and I&#39;m the co-founder of Optimism Brewing Company, Seattle&#39;s largest taproom brewery located on Seattle&#39;s Capitol Hill. I&#39;m here also to speak in favor of the street continuation. COVID obviously hit our business very hard. We&#39;re incredibly grateful for the temporary street permitting. We truly would have had to close our doors without this. But the effect goes beyond our survival. It was an incredible activation for the entire city. Guests eating in fancy restaurants right next to a taco window place is powerful. When you live outside in community with your neighbors, things change. I&#39;m here to speak in favor of the extension beyond October and rulemaking to make this a permanent feature for our city. Keep in mind, this is not just about the cute parking space tables that you see around the city. There are two elements that you might not know about that we in particular benefited from. First, more liberal food truck permitting, because we do not serve food ourselves but partner with tens of minority-owned food trucks by moving the food truck off our own parking property to extend our seating into temporary on-street parking. This was crucial for those trucks&#39; survival during COVID. It expanded their customers and was a great benefit to activation for our entire neighborhood. Second, temporary street closures. Like many businesses, ours actually does not have adjacent parking that we could use for seating. We do have a small side street that we were able to completely close down just in the evenings and weekends when we would need it. Creating all of these options took coordination of SDOT, police, and fire, as well as with our neighbors at a time when no one had any money to put into these things. There were owners nailing up boards and putting up camping tents just to make it work. But the design will get better, and the rules for permitting will evolve, and we should give them ample time to do the work right rather than lose this incredible community feeling. Seattle, we can favor people and businesses that employ them and nourish them over the cars that would normally live in the street. Thank you for the time. Thank you, Gay. Very well said. I appreciate your time and the activation that you have brought to Capitol Hill. Last, we have Jessie Clausen. Jessie, good morning. Hello, council members. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Good morning, Jessie. Great to hear your voice. Hi, everybody. It&#39;s Jessie Clausen, 701 5th Avenue, Suite 6600. I represent the owners of the Bella Bee, which is one of the two mobile home parks which will be impacted by the legislation you&#39;re discussing today. I sent a SEPA comment letter in on Friday outlining our concerns with the SEPA checklist and SEPA determination that was prepared by staff. The SEPA checklist is riddled with errors, and it doesn&#39;t fully analyze the true impact of this legislation, which could be to put these mobile home parks out of business, which is exactly what the council, I think, is trying to avoid in this situation. This is legislation that the council really needs to get right, and there&#39;s an opportunity here to actually assist the people who live at the Bella Bee and at the Halcyon rather than build them out of existence, which we&#39;re very concerned that this legislation is going to do. I also want to note that it appears as though I&#39;m the only person who is commenting publicly today. That raises some public participation concerns for me. During COVID-19, I wonder about council&#39;s outreach to the individuals who live in the mobile home parks and asking them what they think this legislation could do for the parks. In terms of SEPA, we request that the SEPA comment period be extended to 30 days rather than the 14-day optional comment period so that it gives time for staff to actually analyze the SEPA impacts and for council to have that information in front of them before they consider this legislation. Thanks very much. Thank you, Jessie. IT, can you confirm there are no further speakers? There are no other public comment registrants. Thank you. Seeing as we have no additional speakers remotely present, we will move on to the next agenda item. Our first item of business today is a briefing discussion and vote on Council Bill 12068, which extends street cafe and cafe street permits. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the item, the abbreviated title into the record? Agenda item one, Council Bill 12068, an ordinance relating to street and sidewalk use, amending ordinance 125706 and the street use permit fee schedule in the Seattle Municipal Code. Thank you, Mr. Ahn. We are joined today by Elise Nelson from SDOT and Calvin Chow Central staff. Elise and her team have moved mountains this year to approve street cafe, sidewalk cafe and curb space permits. Their team has stretched as far as they can go, which is why I oftentimes refer to their work. They are, they do wizardly work and can create new use of, they can, they give us the ability to use our streets in so many new ways. And it&#39;s, as we heard from public commenters, this has saved businesses. I&#39;ve heard from many businesses that they have been saved during this pandemic because we allowed them to operate in our streets. And so I want to thank Elise and her team up front for all of that work to make this possible, to make today possible. We&#39;re going to hear from Elise and Calvin, and then I have an amendment to add to the legislation. This is important that we move as quickly as possible to give businesses the certainty that they need to be successful for the next year, which is why I have an amendment that was not included in the original draft. Elise, Calvin, welcome. Could you both introduce yourselves and take us away? Good morning, council members. I&#39;m Calvin Chow with council central staff, and I&#39;ll be doing the presentation of your legislation and amendment council member Strauss and Elise is here to help us with any questions with the program. Elise, do you want to introduce yourself? Yeah. Thank you for having me today. I&#39;m Elise Nelson. I&#39;m the acting public space manager for street uses public space management group, and I&#39;m happy to be here and help answer any questions you have. Great. So trying to share, sorry, council members. So council member Strauss, at your direction, I drafted some legislation for it to extend the cafe streets permit. If you&#39;ll remember last year, SDOT started a new program to allow for temporary business uses of sidewalks and curb space vending displays and cafe uses. And that program was currently authorized through October 31st, 2021, basically through the street use fee schedule. A lot of the existing program is administered under SDOT&#39;s administration of the right-of-way and council&#39;s focus to date has really been in establishing the fee schedule. That could change in the future depending on where the program goes, but the legislation in front of you today amends that street fee schedule to allow the free use permits through May 31st, 2022. It&#39;s a very simple piece of legislation. It literally just changes the table A2, which established the temporary business uses and extends that to May 31st of next year. You also asked to have a proposed amendment, amendment number one, and this does two things. It adds a new section two that allows SDOT to waive permit fees for existing long-term permit holders. And so those folks who use the right-of-way in a similar way under the long-term permits would have the same fee waiver through May 31st as the temporary users. And then you also added a new section or you&#39;re proposing to add a new section three, which would direct SDOT to develop a long-term program with a draft proposal due on December 15th and a legislative proposal due on May 31st. And then, Alyse, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any comments or things that you might want to say at this point. I&#39;ll just say that, you know, we support the amendments here and are working steadily to think about what the permanent program should look like. So this seems totally within reach for us as far as a timeframe. And council member, I don&#39;t know that this is a very complicated piece of legislation, but if there are any questions or things that you would like us to get into further, be happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Calvin and colleagues, you know, from my past practice, I like to have bills before the committee for two meetings before passing them. So as not to rush anything, to ensure everyone has time to comment, ask questions and have a deliberative process because this bill has been before us before, because this bill is simply changing the date for the extension of the free permits. And because this bill is setting forward a work plan for the pathway to permanency, I would love to be able to move this out of the committee today. I want to frame our conversation today that we started off with a pilot program, and this is a pathway to permanency. So between having a pilot and the permanent regulations, we need to have this interim moment to give SDOT time to complete the final outreach, to ensure that the fee schedule is correct and we are giving, creating spaces that are accessible for all ages and abilities, as well as this legislation will give businesses an additional year of free permits for them to recover from the pandemic. And so I do want to call out Alisa&#39;s team again, they could have been doing this research and doing this outreach in the last year to create a pathway to permanency right now. However, they were using their time to ensure that they got as many permits out the door as possible. And so I just again want to congratulate and thank Alisa and her team for spending their time in that way. Otherwise, we would not have as many curbspace sidewalk cafe or cafe street permits out there right now. So just really good job. I do see we have a couple of questions. I see Councilmember Peterson and then Councilmember Lewis. Councilmember Peterson, please take it away. Thank you, Chair Strauss. Thanks for bringing this legislation forward. I definitely support extending this through, you know, as we are still in the pandemic and businesses are struggling and some of those have made those capital investments to set things up. I do want to learn more about, and I&#39;ll have questions when we get closer to anything being permanent. Just want to better understand. So SDOT is being asked to come back in December with a plan and then legislation in March. So what exactly is being made permanent? The fact that businesses can, that there&#39;ll always be this program available to them to for free get permits to occupy the space, or is it that their existing permits would be made permanent? Great questions, Councilmember. So this is a pathway to permanency. Elyse has been great in educating me, and please, Elyse, jump in if I get any of this wrong, that these permits already exist within SDOT&#39;s purview. So businesses could in the past have applied for these permits. What has been prohibitive is the cost associated with the permits because in some ways, and sometimes they are associated with the amount of money that a parking space would generate in revenue. We heard from public commenters today that that might not be the right fee to associate with the permit because it&#39;s cost prohibitive for the business, and we&#39;re not taking into consideration the other aspects of sales tax revenue generation. So that&#39;s something that we need to look at. Again, I brought up earlier that we need to make sure that these spaces are accessible for all ages and abilities. And so there&#39;s some of these small tweaks that need to be made to the existing program. What does need to be legislated is removing the requirement of SDOT to charge a fee. And so I wanted to provide businesses that additional year to recover without having to pay for these while we finalize these regulations of a currently existing program. Elyse, did I get that right? Jump in if I missed anything. No, I think you did a really good job summarizing. I would just add, like you said, that partly we see this as an extension to give us more time to really work through some of what we&#39;ve done so far, what&#39;s working well, what maybe could be changed, and really to listen to businesses and residents to hear what their perspectives are. We haven&#39;t had as much time to do that outreach and engagement. So I think in addition to hearing from permit holders and understanding their experience a little bit better, we also want to make sure we&#39;re reaching out and listening to business districts in general and residents to understand what they&#39;re seeing and appreciating or not about the program to refine maybe our strategy moving forward into a permanent proposal. Like Council Member Strauss said, we do have existing tools in our toolbox. And so I think that part&#39;s there for us, but there might be some refinements that we want to make in addition to thinking about the fees and what&#39;s appropriate moving forward. And to add on to that, which is I always like to be upfront and public about how we&#39;re going to do outreach. So it gives everyone the most opportunity to participate, which is why we wanted to include it in the legislation today. Thank you, Chair. This is, again, it would be potentially making permanent that it would be a free cost. There&#39;d be no cost to the business, but it&#39;s not necessarily giving somebody a permit in perpetuity to occupy that city space. Correct. So permits always have a lifetime that they then have to be renewed. So even in the last year, the existing permits expired and Elisa&#39;s team had to re-review all permits. So that&#39;s why we know, for instance, on Ballard Avenue, 35 out of 36 businesses surveyed were supported. And so no matter when a permit is, you know, they can have, SDOT can have a permanent pathway. Permits are always have expirations and have to be renewed. This legislation does not make these permits free in perpetuity. The free aspect is only for one year. And this legislation outlines what additional outreach needs to occur before we make any permanent changes. If I may just add, our permits are temporary and revocable. So, you know, we can&#39;t guarantee a long-term use of the right-of-way through a permit, but you know, that&#39;s not, we&#39;re not in the game of going out and revoking unnecessarily, but, you know, there&#39;s no guarantees, I guess, for long-term use of the right-of-way. Thank you. Council Member Peterson, any other thoughts, questions? No, I&#39;ll look forward to it in December and then I can ask questions then or leading up to December so that things are incorporated in whatever they provide in December. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Council Member Lewis, please. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am certainly very supportive of this legislation and I appreciate the phasing of this approach. I actually wanted to ask something sort of related to the end of the discussion with Council Member Peterson just now, which is that I know a lot of business owners have, you know, certainly have plans, you know, just from my conversations with a lot of folks who have decided to take on these streeteries that have sort of more ambitious plans in the future for the nature of the streetery, you know, like putting in semi-permanent platforms instead of just having them on the asphalt, on the pavement, putting in, you know, other kind of features that, you know, for example, putting it on a platform with a ramp which could make it more ADA compliant, for example, but also has an impact in sort of putting down a more permanent footprint on the right-of-way. Just to put my cards on the table, I&#39;m all for that. I mean, I see the tension as basically being between use as a streetery or use for vehicle parking. And I think between those competing interests, I would prefer that we have these streeteries. That seems to be the overwhelming consensus, too, of most of the businesses I talk to, though I want to say not all. And that is just anecdotal. I haven&#39;t done like a scientific survey or anything, but the folks that I have talked to have noticed a real uptick in business. I mean, I similarly, Council Member Strauss, have spent a decent amount of time on Ballard Avenue where the streetery program really is credited with giving a real shot in the arm to those businesses during the most bleak times of the pandemic and increasing foot traffic and creating sort of almost a festival-like atmosphere because you have people outside mixing around. So going towards the future, I would like to keep that lightning in a bottle in our local economy. I would like to expand it. And I would like businesses to be able to make that investment, to have a quasi-permanent and more sophisticated streetery that does have some of those additional infrastructure improvements instead of just basically a plywood frame that is over the street. But that would seem to implicate giving a little bit more time and a little bit more guidance and maybe a right of renewal if there is compliance with the permitting. Because I could see an issue if we&#39;re expecting people to sort of annually kind of reapply in a competitive process and if it&#39;s sort of an arbitrary decision, people making big investments in these sophisticated streeteries, the city then coming in and saying, actually, we want more parking here. And I would like a little bit of deference to if a business owner makes this investment and if they&#39;re current on everything and if they&#39;ve been complying with the terms of their permit, they can just keep rolling it over unless there&#39;s some kind of urgent need where the city has to come in, like maybe we have to, you know, replace a gas main or something and it would require removal of the streetery. But barring something like that, I&#39;d like people to be able to rely on the investment that they&#39;ve made as a business to keep it there and to keep it in place. So I guess I just wanted to throw it out there if, yeah, I guess that&#39;s also sort of feedback and guidance as we continue to develop as a central staff and a department what that final legislation is going to look like down the road, making sure that we have that consistency and making sure that we have that priority so that people can invest in these more souped up and sophisticated streeteries that are also just really great additions to our built environment. There&#39;s a particularly great one in Councilmember Peterson&#39;s district at Big Time on the Ave, for example, that is a much more sophisticated structure. So I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s necessarily a question there or if that was just more guidance for the conversation, but I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this and I appreciate that this is going to be something coming out of the pandemic that we are going to really lean into and make a bigger part of what we do in reclaiming street space for social and business uses instead of just single vehicle parking. So well said, Councilmember Lewis. I know Elyse has educated me many times over about the need to possibly address utility problems underneath the street and that&#39;s something that we have to take into consideration as well as I&#39;ll highlight term permits by SDOT, even for structurally sound pedestrian bridges, for instance, the one on Westlake in your district, they are also on term permits and so they have the same legal language that is included in these that are temporary and revocable despite and it&#39;s for legal reasons, despite the pedestrian bridges being very permanent. Elyse, do you have any other thoughts to share? Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. So I would note that we have had a permanent streetery and parklet program for several years. I think it started in 2015. And so we are seeing people, businesses making investments in more kind of permanent type streetery structures. And when we are reviewing something like that, you know, part of our permit review process is really to make sure we&#39;re permitting something that we think there&#39;s some certainty that it can stay for that business investment reason. We don&#39;t want to be having to work with somebody to remove something in a shorter duration. So, you know, we&#39;re working with folks that are looking at the modal plans and is this curb space going to stay for parking? Is it planned for something different in the future? We&#39;re looking at future construction and utility impacts. So that&#39;s something that we do because we want to make sure that when people are investing in a curb space, despite the fact we can&#39;t guarantee it, that we&#39;re doing what we can to limit that future state from occurring. So I wanted to mention that. And then just to clarify, public space management long-term permits that we issue, you know, they do have an annual renewing cycle, but we don&#39;t re-review or kind of make a different decision at a yearly basis. We&#39;re doing, you know, we&#39;re doing work to inspect and to, you know, invoice if that&#39;s appropriate, but we don&#39;t necessarily make a change to their approval at that time. And if I could just add, I mean, I think, you know, since we have seen the growth of the use of these types of uses on our streets, it really is time for broader conversation with, you know, the folks who are taking advantage of that, the folks who are impacted by it to understand, you know, what does that mean for how SDOT administers the program. That could be administrative changes that are wholly done on the SDOT side that could require legislative changes that will likely require a rate change. It&#39;s probably not a free permit, but how does the cost center sort of shift the cost to make that, to make that work long-term? So this is to buy us some time to kind of understand what that is. And then there will be time for council to take this up next year. Thank you, Calvin. And thank you, Elise. Very well said. I&#39;ve got a couple of questions and I see Vice Chair Mosqueda has some questions, so I&#39;ll wait to see if others ask the questions that I have. Vice Chair Mosqueda, please. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thanks for the presentation today. And thank you, Mr. Chair, for bringing forward this legislation.
As you and I chatted yesterday, I mentioned that the, you know, there was an opportunity that I was trying to eke out of the federal ARPA funds to see if there was any way for us to continue or put a mark down to make sure that these type of supports for our smallest restaurants and folks trying to encourage people to get back out and post-vaccine, enjoy our local eateries, if we could include that in ARPA some way. And so your legislation is very timely, I think, and probably a more appropriate vehicle for making sure that this program continues and that we do the research necessary. So I&#39;m very supportive of this. And as we get additional guidance from ARPA, I think your legislation is probably the best vehicle at this point to make sure that that program continues. So thanks again for bringing this forward. The question that I had for the department, you know, one of my favorite local breweries, I had some great examples of how this has been a wonderful asset for allowing them to stay afloat during this time. And I think that as patrons around the city have noted, this is also something that I think is encouraging people to want to get back out, especially since we all want to enjoy nice days out there and when there&#39;s cover, hide from the rain. One of the things I&#39;m hearing, though, from others is, I guess, a concern around timing. Are there a few things that you&#39;d like to flag for us in anticipation of the stakeholder discussions that you&#39;re to have that you think are the top two or three issues that you&#39;re hoping to address as you have stakeholder engagement? Like, what are some of the concerns that you&#39;re hearing that you&#39;re hoping to get more understanding of so that we can have policy solutions for? Thanks for the question. I think one of the things we want to make sure we&#39;re doing is hearing from all of our businesses, like not just people who are participating in the program, you know, but really generally and more broadly, business districts and understanding the different needs and wants of the entire community. So, I think one of the issues that comes up is around parking and the loss of parking and the impacts that businesses feel about that loss and kind of trying to understand how to think about that from a perspective. I think during the pandemic, we really saw a need to work and activate as much outdoor space as we could so businesses had an available spot to serve customers. And I think that, you know, we have worked closely with our colleagues in the curb space management group and they&#39;ve been very supportive of the work done so far. And, you know, I think that&#39;s one of the things that the balance is that we need to strike is like between the parking and the activation use and just kind of considering what the temperature is among the community for that. I think that&#39;s one main thing. I think, you know, obviously, I think businesses that have been participating or maybe want to participate will obviously be interested in the fees part of it and what we want to come up with as far as a fee framework moving forward. I guess the other thing I&#39;d say is we&#39;re curious about maybe if we should add more tools to our toolbox, our permitting toolkit, so to speak. You know, we have seen temporary curb space cafes and displays pop up. You know, I mentioned we have a permanent program for street areas and parklets, but we have about a dozen or so permanent street areas and parklets where we have over 100 curb space cafes now. And so I think it&#39;s interesting to think about that shift and what made it more accessible besides the permitting fees and then how that might frame some new options maybe for temporary uses over the summer. You know, so in addition to adding like more like thresholds around the design and permanence for people who want that, maybe we want to have some more options for kind of temporary use too. So I&#39;m curious to explore that kind of concept too with the business community. Very well said, Elyse, and I look forward to that discussion about what additional tools we can put in your tool belt to help businesses in our city. Council Member Lewis, I still see a hand. Is that an old hand? It is an old hand. Oh, great. I do have a couple questions, Elyse, and Vice Chair Mosqueda got to some of it. Can you, you know, I&#39;ve heard from many businesses that this saved them over the last year. You know, the flexibility to use their outside spaces serving customers during the changing realities of the COVID-19 pandemic has provided them that lifeline because as public health guidance has changed, they&#39;re still able to use their outdoor spaces. Would you be able to share some feedback that you&#39;ve heard from businesses about what&#39;s going well and what&#39;s not going well? Yeah, I&#39;ve heard similar input, Council Member Strauss, as far as the businesses that have permits really have benefited from being able to use the outdoor space. I think that we, you know, we&#39;ve seen a lot of people think that they&#39;re really critical to the success of their business. And we honestly haven&#39;t received a lot of negative feedback. I think when we have, it&#39;s been around the loss of parking and just that kind of prioritization of activation and streetery kind of use over parking and what&#39;s the right scale for that. We have been working to make sure that there&#39;s clear paths for loading, you know, so we&#39;re still like thinking about loading when we&#39;re looking at activating the curb. But in general, I think, you know, we haven&#39;t received a lot of negative comments to date, but that&#39;s one of the reasons we want to make sure to have a robust outreach process. So we&#39;re hearing from people who are really happy and we&#39;re hearing from people who may not have permits who want them and like, what&#39;s their barriers? Why are they not applying? And then, you know, businesses who might not see a need for this and maybe have some concerns and work through that with them. So that&#39;s kind of what we&#39;re excited to do. And I think we&#39;re excited to have this extension because then we give businesses who might not have applied yet an opportunity to make use of this over the summer months and into next year, you know, because I think there might be some concern if they know it expires in October, like would they, do they want to make the investments this summer? So I&#39;m also excited to continue to work throughout the spring and summer to get more interest in the program that we have now, the pilot program, so to speak. And I think that&#39;ll also help inform the permanent program development. Thank you. Well said. Vice Chair Mosqueda, do you have a question? Yeah, just that prompted another comment that I&#39;d love to make, Mr. Chair. Thanks for the question and thanks for the answer, Elise. I also want to echo the other council members&#39; comments about the desire to continue to see a decreased number of parking slots overall. I think this is a great example of how we can activate that space and potentially create additional revenue by, you know, generating more economic activity for the smallest businesses, which in turn also helps the city, et cetera. But as we think about ways to address the loss of parking spaces, making it safer for people to walk and bike is critical, making it more accessible to get on transit is important. So I&#39;m hoping that the stakeholder outreach also involves a more robust, holistic discussion about what are alternatives to those parking spaces. Just felt like that needed to be said because parking and kind of the one side of the consequence of losing that space has come up a few times, but I want to lift up the why I think folks are very important in replacing those parking spaces. And then as I say that, I wanted to mention something that has come up for the last few years, and this is pre-COVID, but especially important as we think about a post-COVID recovery, and that is creating spaces for our musicians and artists to be able to have a space to unload or park their vehicles. I think it&#39;s probably more important to make sure that those artists don&#39;t have to run out and pay the meter midway through their gig. And also recognize that in many cases, artists are not earning large incomes and having to pay a certain portion, whether it&#39;s $15 or $30 on parking, it really eats into the potential revenue for those artists and musicians. And one thing that&#39;s come up directly from the artist community is having a space out in front of certain business areas or in certain business districts that allow for them to have free parking. So that is potentially something to add to your list of stakeholder strategies or discussions to consider so that more musicians can have a place to unload heavy equipment like drums and make sure that they can get in and out of those spaces into places where they&#39;re hopefully going to be able to play music very soon and patrons will be able to enjoy it. And that also allows for them to not have to pay their income back to the city in the form of parking fees. So I just thought it was a good opportunity to marry those two concepts today. Well said, Vice Chair, in addition to the fact that artists are not paid enough money to perform for the room that is being entertained, and then they have to split that little bit of money amongst however many people are in their band. And then to have to pay parking, I mean, well said. Calvin, I see you have your hand raised. Council members, I just wanted to state, I think one of the issues that you all are raising is sort of the issue of thresholds, where it&#39;s one thing when maybe one individual business wants to pursue a permit, that&#39;s generally how we&#39;ve tended to work with these things. But now we have larger sort of district impacts. And what does that really mean in the broader context? And I think that&#39;s really what this new proposal is meant to try to understand, is how do we approach that type of request, that type of desire? So I think there&#39;s a question of thresholds and a question of how is the SDOT going to manage that? That will have to overlap with parking, will have to overlap with curb use. So I think it remains to be seen just how far this program is going to go. I think there&#39;s a lot of things that they could approach, and we&#39;ll have to get something that they can actually implement, and it may be incremental, as I see that there&#39;s a lot of interest in expanding the scope of this. Well said, Calvin. And Vice Chair Mosqueda brought up ARPA dollars as an avenue to make this a permanent feature in our city. And I do want to highlight that there is a need for federal relief to this program because public space management is a fee-based, operates off of the fees that it generates. And so for Elise and her team to continue operating, they have been operating at a deficit because we have not been charging businesses for these permits. And so I just want to raise that, Vice Chair Mosqueda. That is a high priority of mine to have them be able to receive some of those ARPA dollars. Great to talk to you about that yesterday. Elise, I just have two more questions. You know, you&#39;ve been hearing from me since January and how we can make this permanent. And I think that the step that we&#39;re taking today is the right next step. Can you speak to some of the reasons why the intermediate step is important before establishing the permanent program? And what are some of the key considerations in establishing the permanent program? Yeah, thank you, Council Member Starr. I think, like I mentioned, I think extending it is the right decision at this point in time just because we&#39;re already in May. And, you know, these permits right now expire in October. And what we&#39;ve heard is the importance of certainty in the business community. And so we want to provide that. And while this doesn&#39;t give them like permanent long-term certainty, it does give them some additional benefit of time that they know that they&#39;ll have that investment and it will be there for them. I think that it also allows SDOT more time to do equitable outreach and engagement, as well as like I think another benefit is to be able to do more promotion of the existing program now ahead of the sunny weather. If we were trying to do it all before October, I think we would end up doing a lot more of the outreach on what&#39;s next as opposed to having the time to really talk to businesses and encourage them to continue to apply and to review those applications that come in. So I think that&#39;s kind of why I support the extension. I think I&#39;ve spoken a bit to some of the things I think we need to talk about. For one, I just want to hear, I want to listen and understand what the pulse of business communities are, what different advocacy groups are thinking about this, the disability rights advocates, you know, other stakeholders besides businesses, you know, residents. I want to hear from as many people as we can to help inform, because I think it&#39;s always more powerful when you hear from other people and aren&#39;t trying to work too quickly. So I think that again, the extension allows us to do a more robust and thorough job, you know, reaching out to communities we might not otherwise hear from if we&#39;re not doing a thorough job. So you know, I think that will help inform some of the characteristics or questions that we need to engage on to think about that permanent program. But for me, you know, it&#39;s about prioritizing activation and parking and loading and kind of considering the curb space allocation kind of question. It&#39;s about design and, you know, do we want to put more specifications on what design requirements we expect? And then like the permitting toolbox of options. So we want to add to the toolkit of options with more options for temporary uses, that kind of thing. Just and then fees. These would be the last thing I would say. So those are kind of, I think, the big buckets. Hopefully I&#39;m not forgetting anything off the top of my head. But that&#39;s what I would say is some of what I expect to kind of get into. Excellent. Thank you. And I have to again, send my appreciation for continuing to review permits rather than doing the outreach because that has enabled more businesses to utilize these permits. The certainty that we&#39;re providing in this legislation will give our businesses the green light to invest in their outdoor spaces and give them a longer runway to recover. And businesses using outdoor space impacts a lot of people, not just who&#39;s using it. And this is why we need to ensure all perspectives are considered, just as you just mentioned about the outreach program. As we make permanent changes, what is the process for establishing the permanent program that I guess I know what it is I&#39;m asking rhetorically and what stakeholder voices do we need to make sure are heard? Well, I think I want to work with our colleagues in Office of Economic Development to make sure we have a robust list of businesses and business districts and other kind of advocacy groups to represent not just food service, but a variety of different types of businesses. I also want to work with them to help hear from different geographies, different businesses that might have less official BIAs, make sure we&#39;re getting the word out that we&#39;re potentially translating outreach materials and working to have a campaign that hits everyone with a business in the city of Seattle. So that&#39;s like kind of one bucket. And then I really think, you know, disability rights advocates are important to talk to and understand what they&#39;ve been seeing. We worked to create a video that we have on our website that kind of talks about the importance of making sure you keep the sidewalk clear for people that, you know, are using cane to detect or using wheelchairs. So I think continuing to work with them on any permanent programs is another kind of stakeholder bucket. You know, I think those come to mind. There&#39;s probably more, I think more broadly, I&#39;m just interested in hearing from the general public, people who might not be a business owner, but their residents nearby and like what they&#39;re enjoying about these spaces or not hearing from that perspective as well. So, and I think we&#39;ll also work with D.O.N. to try to share the word more broadly and also understand if there&#39;s any other groups that they would recommend that we continue to make sure we reach with our outreach. And I welcome feedback from you all too, if you have any suggestions for people to make sure to talk to. And of course, SDOT has a strong equity team internally. That&#39;s a very good resource for them, particularly for some of the location questions that I know people want investigated or looked into. Excellent. It is clear that you have given this much thought. And with that, I would like to move my amendment one, which does add a new section to allow existing permit holders to, existing long-term permit holders through May 31st to be consistent with the free permit program, as well as it outlines the step, the dates in which we will receive a draft proposal by December 15th, ensuring that no one has to work over the holiday break to make sure that that gets in. And then a legislative proposal due March 31st, 2022, to give us enough time to pass any permanent changes that need to be made before this legislation before us expires on Memorial Day 2022. Again, for reference, the current legislation expires six months from now, and this gives us about 54 weeks of time before the next, before this legislation would expire. So with that, I move amendment one to council bill 12068, as shown in amendment one. Is there a second? Second. Thank you, Council Member Juarez. It has been moved and seconded to amend council bill 12068. If there are no additional comments, looking, seeing no additional comments, will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Juarez? Aye. Council Member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Strauss? Yes. Five in favor, none opposed. Thank you, Mr. Ahn. The motion carries. Colleagues, are there, is there any further discussion on the underlying bill as amended? Seeing none at this time, I just want to highlight again, the great work of Alyse Nelson and the public space wizards that are making this all possible. We did not have the opportunity to have these permits available in this way last summer. So this is going to be the first summer that we see this program fully utilized. And I&#39;m excited to have this legislation before us next Monday on sit-in to my the 17th of May Norwegian Constitution Day and Ballard. We have had the largest sit-in to my parade in the world outside of Norway, and we have not had the opportunity to have that the last two years because of COVID. And so this is going to be a really exciting way to celebrate sit-in to mine. Seeing no further discussion, I move the committee recommend passage of Council Bill 12068 as amended. Is there a second? Second. Thank you. Council Member Juarez, it has been moved and seconded to recommend the passage of the bill as amended. If there are no additional comments, will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Juarez? Aye. Council Member McKayla? Aye. Chair Stroud? Yes. Five in favor, none opposed. Five in favor, none opposed. Thank you. The motion carries. Thank you, Calvin, Elise, all of the public space wizards. This will be before full council next Monday on sit-in to mine. Thank you. Our next item of business today is a briefing and discussion on potential legislation to establish a mobile home park overlay district. Mr. Ahn, will you please read this item into the record? Item 2, proposed mobile home park overlay district. Thank you, Mr. Ahn. This legislation would use our land use code regarding mobile home parks in our city, which provide affordable housing to seniors and working class people. I&#39;m glad to have worked on this and will be introducing legislation with Council Member Juarez, who has worked for years to make, has been working on this for many years. This issue was first brought to City Council&#39;s attention in 2019, and after more than two years of moratoriums and discussion, Council Member Juarez and I are proposing a long-term solution to bring resolution to this important issue. We are joined by Ketel Freeman of Council Central staff, and unless other Council Members have comments before we begin, Mr. Freeman, I guess Council Member Juarez, anything off the top? Nope. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Freeman. Please take it away. Hello, Committee. There&#39;s a lawnmower going outside, so I apologize for that in advance. If you have any problems hearing me, just let me know. Today there&#39;s an initial briefing on a proposal to establish a mobile home park overlay district. Attached to the agenda, you have a memo from me that includes a draft of the bill, and there&#39;s also a presentation, which I&#39;ll walk through here in just a minute, that describes the legislative history, background and context, and the proposed overlay district and next steps. So, unless you have any questions, I&#39;ll just launch, I&#39;ll share my screen and launch into the presentation. All right. Let me get oriented here. As Council Member Strauss mentioned, Council Member Strauss and Council Member Juarez have been working on a proposal to replace the ongoing temporary moratorium on redevelopment of mobile home parks. Let me get over to the right page here. That moratorium was initially established in 2019 through Ordinance 125-764. The instant cause of that proposed moratorium was intended to reduce pressure on the city&#39;s two remaining mobile home parks at the time the Househead mobile home park was up for sale and potential purchasers were looking at redevelopment proposals for that mobile home park. The temporary moratorium has been extended for three additional six-month periods through Ordinances 126-006, 126-090, and most recently through Ordinance 126-241. The current moratorium will expire in July. CEPA threshold determination has been issued for the proposed mobile home park overlay district and we are in the middle of the CEPA comment slash appeal period, as Council Member Forth-Abellaby mentioned in her comments. Background and regulatory context, the city&#39;s two remaining mobile home parks, the Bellaby and the Halcyon, are both located in the Bitter Lake Residential Urban Village. I&#39;ll just use my cursor here, hopefully you can see it. They&#39;re both located here in kind of the southeast corner of the urban village. Zoning in the vicinity is commercial zoning. There&#39;s some confusion about what the actual zoning is now and that&#39;s in part because official city maps don&#39;t reflect the correct zoning. The Council intended to upzone, to actually keep the zoning at C-140 through the MHA Implementation Ordinance and made that recommendation through the committee process. Unfortunately that recommendation was not reflected in the final piece of legislation that was acted on by Council, so the zoning for the site is C-155M, which informs the overlay concept as a regulatory approach. The sites are located, for those just to orient everybody, the sites are located to the east of Aurora Avenue North. You can see kind of in the picture over here to the right, some of the PUDS golf course and just above it a Lincoln Towing Yard. Both of those sites are currently being redeveloped or are the subject of purpose redevelopment. There are approximately 240 units proposed for both of those sites. I think Council Members have any questions about the context here? I guess I should mention that, as you all know, residential urban villages have growth estimates, so not quite targets, but estimates of how much growth may occur in an urban village over the 20-year planning period. Bitter Lake is well on its way towards achieving its growth target. It&#39;s about 30% of its growth target has been achieved in about the six years of the 20-year planning period. So how do other jurisdictions preserve mobile home parks? This is not an issue that&#39;s unique to the City of Seattle. A lot of jurisdictions, as part of their affordable housing strategies, have put in place preservation sort of regulatory schemes to help preserve mobile home parks, which are a source of nationally occurring affordable housing. Tumwater, as many of you know, has a mobile home park zone that was created in 2008 that was the subject of a lawsuit in federal court and zoning for Tumwater was upheld. Bothell has had a mobile home park overlay since about 1996 to promote retention of parks with rental lots. And Kenmore most recently adopted an approach to preserve the existing mobile home parks in Kenmore, phased zoning with a 10-year horizon for certain mobile home parks and longer-term protection for two mobile home parks. I think this has been the subject of a growth board appeal and may still be on the growth board. So the proposed overlay, what would it do? It would establish, maybe just for the interest of demystifying some jargon here, you may wonder what is an overlay or folks may wonder what is an overlay. It&#39;s a supplemental, typically more restrictive set of development standards that are on top of the underlying zoning, so they overlay the underlying zoning. Seattle has many overlay districts. Probably the one that people are most familiar with is the Shoreline Overlay District, which is a set of more restrictive development standards that are in place in the shoreline to preserve the shoreline for water-dependent and water-related uses. That overlay implements the Shoreline Management Act, sort of an overlay that the city operationalizes on behalf of the state. Every jurisdiction in Washington does that. And Mr. Freeman, I see Council Member Juarez, would you like to ask your question now or wait until the end of this? I just wanted to make a clarification, Ketil, if we can, and Chair. Just so when people are watching, it isn&#39;t just a mobile home park. These are manufactured mobile home parks in which they&#39;re actually homes that are cemented down with a pad in which people took out loans to buy their homes and they actually lease it. So I think what we are hearing in the last two years and all the public comment, all the hearings that we&#39;ve had when the residents came down from Bellabe and Halcyon made it very clear to us, the visits that we have physically made there, these aren&#39;t like trailer courts. These are actual homes, manufactured homes. And that&#39;s a big distinction. So I just wanted to make sure we&#39;re clear on that. Sure. Yeah, absolutely. And you are correct. And of course, an associated difficulty with relocating those mobile homes is that if they are old, if the manufactured home is old, relocation is not really an option and relocation ultimately results in the destruction of the mobile home. Correct. Thank you. They can be, they&#39;re just like a home. They can be, they can make, not make payments on their mortgage. So they&#39;re not actually, you know, moving around. They&#39;re actually cemented down as homes. So thank you. Yeah. So what would the overlay do? It would limit residential uses to mobile homes and mobile home parks. That would be the only kind of residential use allowed in the overlay zone. It would establish a minimum and maximum residential densities for mobile home parks in the overlay. It would allow some commercial uses. So as I mentioned earlier, the zoning here is commercial. And so some commercial uses would be allowed, but it would limit the size of those uses. There&#39;d be heightened setback limitations for commercial uses to make that consistent with ongoing mobile home park residential use. And then there would be some development standards that would kick in if a mobile home park was redeveloped. Specifically, if somebody really redeveloped a portion of the mobile home park above a 25% threshold, they&#39;d be required to provide some amenities for mobile home park residents. Finally, the mobile home park would be temporary. It wouldn&#39;t last. I mean, the mobile home park overlay would be temporary. It wouldn&#39;t last for forever.
The legislation does change the cap for event rate on street paid parking hourly rates. Right now the cap is five dollars an hour for us to charge for on street paid parking. This would lift the cap for events to twelve dollars an hour. However I want to make very clear that our intent in October when the arena opens is not to charge twelve dollars an hour. Our plan is to start with the progressive rate structure and again we&#39;ll go into that in more detail in a few slides. But for those that are just staying in the in the Uptown area for a couple hours they would only pay three dollars an hour. It&#39;s for those final three hours if you risk to stay for three or four or five hours. We&#39;re proposing to charge eight dollars an hour for those for those last three hours. So I just want to make that clear and we can do a little math as we get further into the presentation about what that means for someone who is who&#39;s staying for something like four hours for an arena event. But outside of event days our regular on street paid parking rates will apply. In Uptown right now that&#39;s 50 cents an hour. A next point I want to make is we obviously want folks to take transit where they can to bike to walk to events at the arena. But we also understand people will drive to to cracking games and other arena events. There are a lot of off street parking options in the neighborhood. Some of those are private facilities. The Seattle Center operates a number of facilities. Some of those will be reservable whether private or Seattle Center. I was just looking today and realized I could actually reserve my off street parking for concerts in March of 2022 today. There are also off street parking options downtown right near where the monorail ends at Westlake. And that&#39;s just a 90 second ride from Westlake to Seattle Center. So there are a lot of other options besides folks trying to drive into the neighborhood and circle around for that that cheap on street parking which is what we&#39;re trying to prevent. The final point I want to make and I think this will be covered in the proposed amendment is that this really is specific to the Climate Pledge Arena and outcome of our work over the past couple years there. We don&#39;t have any intent anytime in the near future to consider event paid parking rates around areas like the stadiums and the Soto and Pioneer Square in Chinatown International District area. If we were to do that at some point in the future we would obviously engage in a super robust outreach effort with neighborhood businesses representatives and others. So I know that would be covered again a little bit later on but wanted to reinforce it up top that this really is specific to the uptown area. With that I will let Ruth Harper and our team go ahead with the next few slides and provide a little bit of context for what we&#39;re proposing here today. Hi thank you. My name is Ruth Harper and good morning to everybody and thank you Mike for that great introduction. So this slide really highlights the center of this effort which is a remodeled arena that is opening in October and we want to support the neighborhood and also support access for residents businesses and visitors. There are new transit and bike lanes being installed right now. We are working with the arena and Seattle Center staff to create a plan to manage ride hailing services such as Lyft and Uber and one of the highlights of this plan also includes mitigating traffic when there are events at the arena with over 10,000 attendees and of course it&#39;s really vital that all of this is in place before the arena opens. Next slide please. So on May 24th we released a curbspace plan with expanded restricted parking zone that&#39;s for residents permit parking and expanded paid parking to support the business district and we are currently working with businesses to ensure that their loading needs are met as well as adding disabled parking. As Mike said we&#39;re here today to discuss legislation regarding event rates for arena events with over 10,000 anticipated attendees but I would like to give you a quick summary of the rest of the curbspace plan which we&#39;ve been working on for a long time. So next slide please. And so here&#39;s a map because maps are helpful. This is the uptown neighborhood and I just want to talk a little bit about the slide that you&#39;re looking at and so when you look at the slide you see lots of things but primarily blue and orange and so where you see a solid orange line that&#39;s where we have restricted parking zone parking right now that&#39;s zone 13 for residents and that has been in place for many years and where you see solid blue lines that&#39;s where we have paid parking in existence today and that has also been in place for many years. So where you see the shaded orange that is where we are going to be expanding the restricted parking zone for residents and so what that means is that if you&#39;re a resident you can get a permit to park and you can park there for longer than a two-hour time limit between the hours of 7 a.m and 6 p.m, seven days a week and then you need a permit to park between 6 p.m and midnight, seven days a week. So you cannot park without a permit on the orange blocks and in those shaded orange areas where we&#39;re expanding the rpz and the paid parking again is on the blue solid blocks and we are expanding that into the areas that you see in blue and those are primarily commercial and retail locations where there&#39;s certainly commercial retail at the ground level and office buildings things like that and so we are proposing that the event rates would take place or would be charged on those blocks with paid parking again only when there are events at the arena with greater than 10,000 anticipated attendees and then this map also shows the bike lanes and transit lanes and bus routes and I know it&#39;s a lot on one map. Next slide please. So this again really just highlights the support that we&#39;ve had and some of the outreach that we&#39;ve done. We&#39;ve done outreach as Mike said for years working with the Uptown Alliance in particular since 2017. We&#39;ve done targeted outreach starting with an initial survey in September, a draft proposal in December, a restricted parking zone hearing in March and then a final plan mailer in May. So that&#39;s four mailers that we&#39;ve done in addition to a lot of presentations we&#39;ve made at meetings. We distribute door hangers throughout the business district and we always do outreach with stakeholders before any proposed changes to garner feedback and also get support and so we have really high support especially for our goals here and you can see that the second goal is to discourage arena event goers from using area on street parking. So we really want people to be able to access the neighborhood for other things. We don&#39;t want the entire neighborhood to be just completely full with no way for anyone to park anywhere in the neighborhood if they&#39;re doing something besides an event. And then in addition we have 71 percent of people believe that the on-street event parking rates would really help limit event goer parking and preserve access for local business customers. And so I&#39;m going to set this back over to Mike but I also want you to know that I&#39;m happy to answer any questions later. I&#39;ve been immersed in this effort now for several years so thank you very much. Great thanks Ruth. Next slide please and this is our last I believe substantive slide but we have a scheduled slide after this. So this is sort of the gist of the legislation. As referenced before again we currently have authority in the smc to charge between 50 cents an hour and five dollars an hour. We&#39;ve been looking and talking with the Oakview group arena folks looking at rates around the rest of the area to see sort of what comparable off-street rates might look like. Our job is to be completely competitive but is to price the on-street parking in the uptown area again to try to prevent event goers from circling for cheap on-street parking and really causing a lot of congestion and problems in the neighborhood during events. Excuse me. What we&#39;re proposing is a progressive rate structure as I kind of mentioned at the top. So again the idea is we want folks who are coming to the neighborhood not going to events to be able to access businesses so for the first two hours the rate would be in October when we start three dollars an hour. For the hours three four and five the rate would be eight dollars an hour. So again if you&#39;re thinking about someone getting dinner and they&#39;re parking for two hours that&#39;s going to be six dollars for an on-street paid parking rate. For someone who is at the arena for four hours their charge is going to be twenty two dollars. So that&#39;s the first two hours at three dollars an hour the second two hours of their stay at eight dollars an hour and then we will do what we always do with the rest of our paid parking. So since 2010 we&#39;ve had a data-driven system where we collect data and then we adjust rates accordingly. We&#39;re really looking for what is an industry sweet spot of about 70 to 85 percent occupancy and so we will take the same approach here in Uptown and the surrounding area once we start with event rates here and we&#39;ll look at transactions, we&#39;ll look at paid, we&#39;ll look at parking occupancy and we&#39;ll see how things are going. Our experience over the last 10 years is we&#39;ve actually adjusted rates down almost as much as we&#39;ve adjusted rates up and we really do just follow the data. So again what we&#39;re looking for here is authority to raise the rate cap to twelve dollars an hour but again we will start at eight dollars an hour as our highest rate. Much like our existing on-street paid parking rate right now coming out of COVID as you may know we we reduced all rates to 50 cents an hour and we&#39;ve been following the data since to adjust rates incrementally since not knowing how folks would recover and business districts will recover. Our highest current on-street hourly rate is two dollars and fifty cents an hour so it&#39;s the same theory. We have a rate cap it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re charging the highest rate authorized by council. Next slide please. And so this is our last slide just on schedule so much of this has been done. It&#39;s the two years that that led up to our releasing the plan in May. We are here in July obviously considering legislation. Our next steps are to notify residents that how they can go about obtaining restricted parking zone permits in those areas where we&#39;re expanding especially. We have already begun the efforts to install some of those rpz signs those on-street paid parking areas. That&#39;s a lot of field work work instructions and installation that will occur and the idea is we want to have these changes in place by the time the arena opens in early October. And I think that&#39;s it. Happy to answer questions. Thank you and I think this would be a good time to talk about the amendment because it&#39;s important to note even though this is the research has been done by in the uptown area the bill as it&#39;s written technically would apply to other large events throughout the city. Even though SDOT would would do additional engagement the legislative authority is for the whole city so I think this amendment will will address that. Also I do understand that Council Member Lewis does support the bill for uptown so I know that&#39;s important to a lot of us just to make sure the district council members is you know where they stand on it so he is supporter as I understand it. But Lish if you don&#39;t mind you and Council Member Morales going through your amendment unless you could show it on your screen and Council Member Morales you could address however you want to handle it. Council Member Morales thank you for introducing this amendment. Sure should I share my screen? Yes thank you. Can you see that? Yes. So I&#39;ll walk through this really briefly. The idea is to focus the bill on Seattle Center and events happening at Seattle Center not just at the arena but other large events that occur at the center. So it first takes out the last recital which talks about other large stadiums or arenas. It amends the definition of large event to be a large Seattle Center event and expected to draw at least 10,000 people to Seattle Center. Looking at this right now I would suggest a amendment to the title of this section to be large Seattle Center event as well. Something we missed in drafting. The next section allows for the rates to increase to $12 an hour and it clarifies that it&#39;s for large Seattle Center events and allows for the parking changes to be implemented within a mile of Seattle Center. That&#39;s an area that extends north to McGraw at the top of Capitol Queen Anne Hill. It extends up to Capitol Hill and south to University Street in the heart of downtown Seattle. University Street in the heart of downtown Seattle. So it captures most areas where people would be walking from on street parking spaces to Seattle Center events. And then each other section is just amended to include the word Seattle Center in between large events. Thank you. And committee members just circulated earlier this morning. Of course we just walk on amendments at the committee stage. So thank you for having it drafted and circulated and Council Member Morales if you&#39;d like to speak to it. Sure thanks. Thank you Lish. Appreciate it. So as Chair Peterson mentioned the language that&#39;s as drafted now does include that you know this application could be applied to other venue locations such as the Soto Sports Stadium. And we my office has heard concerns from community members in the CID on the legislation its potential impacts on people living and working in the neighborhood. So I did ask Lish to draft this because I think that before implementing anything beyond the original uptown proposal SDOT really does need to do the extensive a similar kind of extensive community engagement with folks living and working in the CID and Pioneer Square. I do want to say I am fully committed to moving our city away from a dependence on driving supporting more robust multimodal networks and prioritizing public transportation and hiking and rolling. But I firmly believe that folks in the CID have as much right to set the terms for their neighborhood rates as the folks in Lower Queen Anne. Especially given that CID has historically been left out of conversations about what&#39;s happening in their neighborhood, development of the kingdom, the T-Mobile Park, Lumen Field, the streetcar. These are all could all be considered community benefits. Folks in the CID feel like their voices weren&#39;t heard when those conversations were happening. So for that reason I did ask central staff to draft this amendment for this particular legislation and would ask my committee colleagues to support it. And I do want to also say that I may be very supportive of parking changes around stadiums in the CID in the Pioneer Square area but only after folks in those neighborhoods have had the opportunity to be engaged by the city as extensively as the folks in Lower Queen Anne were. That is all I have. Thank you Councilmember Morales. Council President Gonzalez. Thank you Chair Peterson and thank you Councilmember Morales for that framing of the intent behind this particular amendment. I have a question for the folks from SDOT which is really about why this legislation was transmitted in its original form in the first place. In other words, did the executive take into consideration the points that were just made by Councilmember Morales or not? I&#39;m trying to get a sense of how this particular base bill came into being for discussion this morning. Excuse me Chair, I&#39;m happy to answer that. I think our intent in drafting the legislation was aligned with what Councilmember Morales just described. This came out of a couple years of discussion with folks associated with Seattle Center and Climate Pledge Arena development. I think in terms of when we were drafting the bill it probably had more to do with our thinking whether we should be drafting language that was geographically specific or broader if it was in the SMC. I think the amendments as described here are totally in keeping with and consistent with where we want to be as a department in terms of our needing to engage with those neighborhoods well in advance of any kind of consideration of something similar there. I actually spoke with representatives of the CID and Pioneer Square last week as well in response to some of their concerns. They are both representatives also of our curb space access sounding board and it&#39;s important for us to have those kinds of conversations with them. And I think again these amendments are responsive to their concerns and where we want to be and our intent going forward. So I don&#39;t think it was anything intentional. It was more probably philosophically just drafting something that was a little broader instead of more geographically specific but I think these amendments make a lot of sense. Thank you. Thank you. Well colleagues let&#39;s handle some parliamentary procedure here. I&#39;ll go ahead and move the bill to get it on the table officially. We&#39;ll second that and then we&#39;ll go ahead and move this amendment from Council Member Morales. So Council Members I now move that the committee recommend approval of Council Bill 120115 item 4 on our agenda. Is there a second? Second. Thank you. It&#39;s been moved and seconded to recommend passage of the bill. We have discussed amendment one from Council Member Morales that was circulated to the committee and presented on the screen here with the one change that Lish Whitson from central staff mentioned just adding the word Seattle center into the title. It&#39;s throughout the amendment that this is referring to large Seattle center events only for this bill and that amendment. So Council Member Morales would you like to move your amendment? Sure I move amendment one. Second. Okay it&#39;s been moved and seconded to amend the bill as presented with amendment one from Council Member Morales. Any final comments on the amendment? Council Member or Council President Gonzalez. Yeah I just want to make sure that this amendment doesn&#39;t require a change to the bill title. So in other words this amendment doesn&#39;t impact the bill title. We can go ahead and move forward with that without worrying about needing another procedural step around changing the title of the bill. Is that correct Lish? That&#39;s my understanding. Bill titles can be over inclusive but not under inclusive and so this is within the scope of the title. Great thank you so much. I just wanted to make sure that was clear for the record since we are going from a bigger city-wide perspective to a smaller geographic footprint on this particular piece of legislation. Thank you Lish. Thank you Council President. So it&#39;s been moved and seconded to amend the bill with amendment one from Council Member Morales and so any final comments on the amendment itself? Okay will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of amendment one. Gonzalez. Aye. Herbold. Yes. Morales. Yes. Strauss. Yes. Chair Peterson. Yes. Five in favor none opposed. The motion carries and the amendment is adopted. In terms of final comments on this amended bill I am suggesting that we will vote on it today and it would appear on the city council agenda on July 26th and the reason is the media coverage did talk to some small businesses in the uptown area that they said they were not aware of the change so it just will enable a little bit more time for the amended bill to be available for public comment as it approaches the full city council final consideration and the July 26th full city council day is completely fine in terms of the timing as done to confirm that because when you add the 10 days for the mayor to sign and 30 days for it to be effective that&#39;s well still well before the October target date so we&#39;ll just let it stay out there a little bit longer July 26th full council. Yeah Council Member Herbold. Thanks. I did have some questions specifically about public awareness of the changes and I don&#39;t mean within the context of our legislative process and prior to actually implementing. I&#39;m more asking how people seeking to park in this area will know about the parking rates so like when they pull their car to park in this designated area where the rates are higher after a couple hours how will they know before leaving their vehicle that there is this increased rate? I&#39;m happy to start that and if Ruth wants to fill in after that she should feel free. A couple things. One is all of the marketing and communication that will happen with folks that have tickets to attend events. I know the folks at Climate Pledge Arena are heavily engaged in what that will look like. That will include not just parking information. I think that will be substantial but you know how to take transit other ways to access the arena. They are developing partnerships to facilitate use of the monorail so I think a pretty heavy marketing effort with folks that are attending events is part of that. The other on our side that we spent a lot of time in the past couple months on is how do we communicate with the person when they get to the block. So that includes a variety of things. It will include messaging with the pay stations themselves. You know they are digital kiosks and they will have information that they can give to folks. Pay by phone obviously is another option for folks to use for parking on street and messaging with that. And then we have spent a fair amount of time working on updated sign designs that are trying to accomplish what essentially you&#39;re describing Councilmember Herbold which is when a person drives up to a block what are the signals we can give them with the real estate we have available on a sign that lets them know hey if this is an event day the rate might be different. We won&#39;t post the actual rate on the signs themselves but the signs will be updated in a way that look different in this neighborhood that say on event days you need to be realizing there are event rates in place that will lead them to look at either the pay by phone or the pay station for those rates. I&#39;m just thinking about how when you use the pay stations and you hit that plus sign I&#39;m just imagining that it&#39;s 50 cents per hour as you&#39;re hitting it and then once you go over the number of hours where it&#39;s 50 cents and then it just you hit it that one time and then Ben is there a way that yeah thank you so much for it. Well the pay stations and they&#39;re different pay by phone and pay stations are different in the way that you can you can have more ability and pay by phone to actually choose you can change from minutes to hours you can do that in the pay by phone app. On the pay station we&#39;ve worked with our vendor we&#39;re unable to actually have it to push be more than a certain amount which might get actually so you&#39;re not going to get too high you&#39;re just going to get almost more tired of pushing you could push to a max time and that will jump you all the way up and then you can push backwards so that&#39;s but so you&#39;re not gonna all the way just to jump and just see that and the other thing I think that&#39;s important is that you can always hit cancel with your pay by phone you know you can&#39;t cancel when you&#39;re putting in coins but that would there&#39;d be really no way to pay for four hours with coins so and then I guess one more thing I wanted to add is that we&#39;re also developing a website that will be on that that sign and so I&#39;m not saying that everybody wants to go to a website when they get to the block but that website will be promoted and it will also have to the best of our ability all of the climate pledge arena events on it so event parking signs hours different ways of finding where we&#39;re we&#39;re doing our best to think about that hours have you spent talking about that so thank you for that question. Thank you. Thank you Councilmember Herbold. Council President Gonzalez. Thank you. I had some questions sort of in the same vein as Councilmember Herbold. I think the scenarios that that were just discussed you know sort of are based in hypotheticals where the person has already arrived on the scene and is now about to pay for it and so I&#39;d like to go a little further upstream from that and and get a better understanding of how the department is working to educate folks before they make that decision to get in their car and drive to uptown in the first place and in particular I would like to know what role climate arena climate pledge arena is playing in also doing education and outreach and engagement of patrons and visitors to their arena on game days and in advance of game days because we have not done this well historically in in the stadium district as pointed out by Councilmember Morales earlier related to our amendment so I think it&#39;s really important for us to have a conversation and understanding about about what the arena is committing to do how we are fulfilling you know how we are holding the arena accountable to those commitments and how how we as a city are fulfilling our obligation to you know prevent people from making the decision in the first place to drive and and try to park it in uptown which is still going to create congestion and the potential of lack of access for local economy purposes. Yep so again I&#39;ll probably lead to Ruth a little bit so SDOT has been working with the folks at the arena on arena access management plan a lot of that is about how we promote and get people to use modes other than driving into the neighborhood we&#39;ve talked obviously this is a parking discussion but ideally we would like as few people as possible to to drive in circle and park in the neighborhood. The and this is where Ruth can probably do better than I but but the climate pledge arena folks are absolutely committed to promoting alternate ways of getting to the arena as a part of their commitment I think in their transportation management plan to manage congestion and traffic in the area. They can probably we could probably follow up with them actually if there is additional detail on what the individual elements of that plan look like. I&#39;m also confident though that SDOT will be working in advance of the opening of the arena and the first game of the Kraken on an extensive outreach and marketing effort to again our first job is to make sure that those who can get there by transit and other modes besides driving do so and they really fully understand all those options and then after that again those who drive between the folks at climate pledge arena and SDOT we need to be as clear and communicative as possible and early enough where they understand their options so that they know what they&#39;re doing before they leave the home and and come to the uptown area. It will be a I mean this is a sort of a first-time thing so we&#39;re you know in October we&#39;ll probably be working out the kinks a little bit to be honest with you we haven&#39;t had event rates here before so it&#39;s incumbent upon us to do everything we can to get it as right as possible. Ruth if there is more about your conversation specific to the arena access management plan and what climate pledge arena representatives have talked about that would be helpful too.
And we do have quorum, and we&#39;re recording. Yeah. Great. Thank you. The July 14th, 2021 meeting of the Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee will come to order. It is 931 a.m. I&#39;m Dan Strauss, chair of the committee. Will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Here. Council Member Lewis? Here. Council Member Juarez? Here. Council Member Mosqueda? Present. Council Member Strauss? Present. Four present. Thank you. The Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee of the City of Seattle begins our committees with a land acknowledgement. We are acknowledging we are on the traditional and ancestral lands of the First People of this region, past and present, represented in a number of different tribes and as urban natives, and honor with gratitude the land itself and the people of this land. We start with this acknowledgement to recognize the fact that we are guests on this land and should steward our land as such, as guests. This is not a choke checklist. Receiving land acknowledgments cannot be a rote behavior, does not give us a passport to proceed however we previously had desired because we said some words. This is a strong reminder that we are guests and we must steward our work as guests as our time here is short. We have four items on the agenda today, a public hearing and briefing on the resolution that sets the docket for comprehensive plan amendments to be considered next year, a briefing on the racial equity analysis of the urban village strategy and comprehensive plan, and a briefing on SDCI&#39;s quarterly tree protection report, with lastly a briefing on Council Bill 120108, which will amend the Yesler Terrace tree protection plan to allow for the redevelopment of vacant sites while adding to the tree canopy. The next meeting of the Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee will be on Wednesday, July 28, starting at 930 a.m. Understanding that one of our presenters in the second item has a hard stop at 11, we may move that agenda item to the first item. And before we begin, if there is no objection, the agenda will be adopted. Hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted. And at this time, we will open the remote public comment period for the items on today&#39;s agenda. Before we begin, I ask that everyone please be patient as we learn to operate the system in real time. While it remains the strong intent to have public comment regularly included on meeting agendas, the City Council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point we deem that this system is being used or is unsuitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner in which we are able to conduct our necessary business. I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner. The public comment period for this meeting is regularly scheduled for 10 minutes. I&#39;m going to extend it for 30 minutes as we have, I&#39;m going to extend it for 20 minutes seeing as we have nearly 30 public commenters. I will be giving each public commenter a minute to speak because of the number of registrants. I will call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the Council&#39;s website. If you have not yet registered to speak and would like to, you can sign up before the end of public comment by going to the Council&#39;s website. The public comment link is also listed on today&#39;s agenda. Once I call on a speaker&#39;s name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt if you have been unmuted will be your cue that it is your turn to speak. Please begin speaking by stating your name and which item you are addressing. Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of the allotted time. Once speakers hear the chime, we ask you to begin to wrap up your public comments. If speakers do not end their comments at the end of the allotted time provided the speaker&#39;s microphone will be muted after 10 seconds to allow us to call on the next speaker. Once you have completed your public comment, we ask you to please disconnect from the line and if you plan to continue following this meeting, please do so via the Seattle Channel or the listening options listed on the agenda. There is a separate public hearing for item 1, the comprehensive plan docketing resolution. Please reserve your comments on this item for the public hearing. If you have inadvertently been signed up for the wrong list, we will make a change on the back end so that we can get you to the right place. As always, you can always send public comment into my office, Dan.Strauss at Seattle.gov. Public comment period is now open and we will begin with the first speaker on the list. Today we have Michael Ruby followed by Ariana Loreno, Rebecca Levine, Cameron Steinbeck, Laura Lowe, Joshua Morris, Steve Zemke, and I&#39;ll continue listing the folks beyond there. We do have a number of people not present right now. I would like to call you in to call in Martha Baskin, Jessica Dixon, Stuart Nevin, Janet Way, Patience Malaba, David Warren, Jessica Clausen, Emily Herman, Rachel Mazur. We see you not present. Please do call into the line. It is a different line than the listen line. With that, public comment is now open. Mr. Ruby, you are first. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Mike Ruby, Seattle. Ten years. Ten years. It&#39;s been ten years since the city council asked the executive to send it a tree ordinance. DCI recently announced that they are starting a listening tour. Will they keep that up for another ten years? Seattle City Council should pass forward a temporary moratorium on the cutting of any exceptional tree anywhere in the city for any reason until such time as the mayor has signed a new tree ordinance. That will get them moving. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ruby. Up next, we have Ariana Loreno, Rebecca Levine, Cameron Steinbeck, and also Mr. Ahn. We are running one minute for public comment today. Thank you. Ariana Loreno, good morning. Good morning. My name is Ariana Loreno. I would like to thank the OPCD on behalf of B Seattle for finally releasing this racial equity report. We cannot be bold on the next comp plan update without understanding the strengths and challenges in our current growth strategy. Thank you. Thank you. Up next, we have Rebecca Levine, followed by Cameron Steinbeck, and then Laura Lowe. Rebecca, good morning. Good morning. My name is Rebecca Levine. I&#39;m a voter in District 4 and live in Roosevelt. I&#39;m calling today to thank OPCD for finally releasing the racial equity report. And I especially want to thank Councilmember Mosqueda for releasing this — for requesting this study. In 2018, my neighbors got my neighborhood designated as the Ravenna Cowan North National Historic District. Their real goal, though, was to keep their homes out of the Roosevelt Urban Village. I love my 100-year-old home, but all that&#39;s been preserved here is a century-old system specifically designed to exclude low-income people and people of color. And frankly, it&#39;s shameful. We can&#39;t plan for future growth based on racist and inequitable land-use patterns that have been upheld through the Urban Village strategy. We have to do better. Thank you. Thank you, Rebecca. Up next, we have Cameron, followed by Laura Lowe, and then Joshua Morris. Cameron, good morning. Good morning. My name is Cameron Steinbach. I&#39;m a Seattle resident, and I represent FutureWise. I&#39;m also speaking on behalf of the Seattle for Everyone Coalition, of which FutureWise is a member. Thank you for finally releasing the growth strategy racial equity toolkit report. Racial equity toolkit is vital in setting a detailed understanding of the strengths and challenges in the current growth strategy. BIPOC communities know the challenges they face, and their solutions need to be included. Racial equity tools enable this input. As we consider Seattle&#39;s future growth strategies through the 2024 major comprehensive plan update, we must consistently and promptly deploy race and equity lenses. Following them will ensure Seattle holds up to its commitments to racial equity for this generation and those to come. Thank you for releasing this report. Thank you, Cameron. Up next, we have Laura Lowe, followed by Joshua Morris, and then Steve Zemke. I&#39;m still seeing Martha Baskin, Jessica Dixon, Stuart Neven, Janet Way, Patience Malaba, Jessica Klassen, Emily Furman, Rachel Mazur not present. If you would like to speak, please do call in now. Laura, good morning. Good morning. My name is Laura. I live in District 7, 98119. I&#39;m a renter. I&#39;m speaking today on behalf of Share the City&#39;s Action Fund, who is planning to be very involved in the next comprehensive plan update conversations. We first want to thank the Office of Planning and Community Development for finally releasing this report that we&#39;ve really been waiting to see. We cannot go bold on the next comprehensive plan update without understanding what are the strengths and challenges in our current growth strategy, and we want to give an even bigger thanks to Councilmember Mosqueda for asking for this study and being a champion of equitable growth and not repeating the mistakes that we&#39;ve done in the past. I also want to mention our support for tree canopy preservation and protections, in particular in Seattle and Magnolia by Ursula Judkins Viewpoint, by Kubota Gardens, and at Solaris. We believe that we can have a dense, thriving city and also preserve trees. We think that the urban village analysis doesn&#39;t address this, but it would be great to see how our urban village strategy contributed to the loss of beautiful, mature trees in our residential zones, the majority of our city where we can&#39;t build apartments. So these issues are connected. Thank you so much. Thank you, Laura. Up next, we have Joshua Morris, followed by Steve Zimke, Brittany Bush-Bolay. The speakers listed are still not present. We do call on now. Good morning, Joshua. Hi, I&#39;m Joshua Morris, providing comment on behalf of Seattle Audubon regarding tree protections. On the first morning of the heat wave, a reporter called us to ask about the impact of extreme heat on birds. I told her that birds would likely be fine, that they&#39;re able to cool down even at temperatures that are dangerous for humans. The next day, I learned of a mass mortality event at a Caspian tern colony in the industrial district. The terns were nesting on the roof of a building. There was no shade, just unrelenting heat exacerbated by the dark surface of the roof. Many chicks perished outright. Many others were killed or injured after jumping from the roof. One report indicates that more than 100 chicks died. The heat disproportionately impacted the most vulnerable birds, just as it does our most vulnerable human communities. The worst is yet to come. Trees are one of the cheapest, simplest, and most effective tools for reducing temperatures in urban areas. Yet the city is failing to protect them, and timelines for improved tree protection delay. Today, I see the can kicked further down the road. I urge the council to treat this as a climate and justice emergency it is, and act urgently to protect the trees now. Thank you. Thank you, Joshua. Up next is Steve Zemke, followed by Brittany Bush-Bolay. Martha Baskin, you&#39;re not present. Martha is Woody Wheeler. Good morning, Steve. My name is Steve Zemke, representing TreePak. The city has put off now for 12 years updating the Tree Protection Ordinance. The climate crisis is upon us, and we need to protect the health of our communities and people by increasing protection for existing trees and planting more trees. We need to act now to update tree canopy in Seattle&#39;s low-income and formerly redlined areas most susceptible to urban heat impacts. We need to update the 2008 Exceptional Tree Directors Rule, as recommended by the Urban Forestry Commission. That&#39;s not on today&#39;s agenda, which is surprising it&#39;s not mentioned. We need to move the 30% tree canopy goal ahead to 2030. We can&#39;t wait until 2037. We need to look at increasing it to 40% by 2040. We also need to move tree protection on private property to an urban forestry division in an independent Department of Sustainability and Environment. Again, act now. The climate crisis is upon us. We can&#39;t keep waiting and waiting years and years. Thank you. Thank you, Steve. Up next is Brittany Bush-Bolay, followed by Woody Wheeler, and then Richard Ellison. I&#39;m seeing Martha Baskin, Jessica Dixon, Stuart Newman, Janet Way, Patience Malava, Jessica Kloss, and Emily Furman. Rachel Mazur and Jessica Dixon not present. Brittany Bush-Bolay. Good morning. Good morning, Councilmembers. My name is Brittany Bush-Bolay. I&#39;m calling on behalf of Sierra Club Seattle Group. I just want to quickly thank OPCD for releasing the report that will be discussed today and to thank Councilmember Esqueda and everyone else who&#39;s been a real champion of this for a long time now. It&#39;s clear that when we go to the next round of comprehensive plan updates, we&#39;re going to need a very thoughtful and thorough examination of our growth strategy, and the information in this report will help make sure that we&#39;re looking forward to the future and building a Seattle that&#39;s healthy and equitable for people as well as for the planet. Thank you so much. Thank you. And I&#39;ll note that Councilmember Lewis joined us a little while ago. He has been present here. I have seen that Jessica Dixon and Jessica Klosson have signed up for public comment again. At this time, you just need to call in, and IT, I might have you provide instructions in just a minute if we continue to have people having trouble. So up next is Woody Wheeler, followed by Richard Ellison and Colleen McLear. Woody, good morning. Hi, this is Woody Wheeler, and I&#39;m calling about the tree ordinance. On June 29th, 2021, the temperature in Seattle reached 108 degrees, an all-time record, following three consecutive days of 100-degree-plus heat. At least 78 people died from excessive heat in our state. Heat waves are how climate change kills us today, said Frederick Otto of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University. The National Geographic had an issue on this, and they found that a recent study showed that neighborhoods with dense tree canopy and parks and other open spaces averaged about five degrees cooler than neighborhoods without those attributes in the very same cities. An urban canopy can help cool a city. A city&#39;s tree canopy can be considered infrastructure, much like a sewer system or street grid. A developed canopy can mitigate the urban heat island effect, in which pavement and buildings trap and raise temperatures well above those found in natural areas. In the meantime, our trees are getting cut down. Our canopy is diminishing. People are dying, especially in hotter neighborhoods that tend to be lower-income areas where people of color form a larger share of the population. How can we address climate change and support environmental justice at the same time? By passing Seattle&#39;s long-overdue revised tree ordinance. Thank you. Thank you, Woody. Up next, we have Richard Ellison, followed by Colleen McClure, and then Suzanne Grant. Good morning, Richard. I see you there, Richard. You&#39;ve got to press star six, not pound six. There you are. Hello, my name is Richard Ellison. I live in the Wedgwood community. I&#39;m talking about the tree ordinance and the lack of it being taken care of. Going on a carbon diet plan may reduce our emissions, but it will not prepare us for the climate chaos impacts of record hot days, extensive droughts, smoke impacts from regional fires. Satellites suffering from 108-degree heat exhaustion compounded by the urban island heat effect do not find any physical relief by a program reducing carbon auto emissions. The heat and choking smoke from regional fires causing respiratory distress in asthmatics and the elderly will not be relieved by any number of zero-emission public transportation systems. Mayoral candidates throwing themselves at the greatest zero-carbon emissions programs are great soundbites, and they help globally, but don&#39;t make Seattle&#39;s heat exhaustion go away or clear the smoky air or make the rain again in an extensive drought. If your teeth are in pain, you need a dentist, not a diet plan. If you are drowning in a river, you need a boat. Seattle has no climate change impacts plan, only on a go-on-a-carbon diet plan. Mitigation is not hiding in air-conditioned homes or libraries. Mitigation is resting under shade trees that absorb carbon. Mitigation are trees blocking the sun and making shade on a home or an apartment window. It&#39;s converting all the single-family homes. Thank you, Richard. And if you have more comments that you&#39;d like to send in to us, please do so. Up next, we have Colleen McLear, followed by Suzanne Grant, and then Jason Rock. Colleen, good morning. Good morning, City Council. This is Colleen McLear, and I&#39;m here to address the Seattle Tree Ordinance and also our Yesler Terrace development in relationship to trees. As other speakers have noted, the climate change is real. And for 12 years, we&#39;ve dragged through reports, but we have not made any progress on a much more significant tree ordinance protection for our city. And the time is now. It should not get rolled again into budgets and forgotten about until next year. The experts have said that trees can lower the temperatures in city neighborhoods by 10 life-saving degrees, and we have needed that, as other members have also noted, with the climates and temperatures, 108 degrees in Seattle, Portland as well, too. Investing in trees is the same as infrastructure, according to Professor Bradstone from Georgia Tech. And also, the mayor of Stephen Des Moines, Iowa, says the value of trees filter out pollutants, suck up water, and store carbon. So most importantly now, with the Yesler Terrace proposal, it&#39;s so important that we do not allow payment in lieu. It&#39;s a poor substitute for retaining the existing and mature trees and exceptional trees in that neighborhood. So we have further comments that we have submitted in agreeing with TREPAC and their recommendations for a separate entity, the Urban Forestry Division, to take on the private lands and the evaluation of tree retention. And also, we also agree with them. Thank you, Colleen. And please do send in any more comments that you would like to our office. Up next, we have Suzanne Grant, Jason Rock, followed by June Blue Spruce. Suzanne, great to have you emailed with you to understand that today is the tree report. Suzanne, good morning. Hello. Hello, council members. I support the long overdue, oh, I&#39;m Suzanne Grant, and I support the long overdue update of our city&#39;s tree protection ordinance. But due to your delay, You, the council members, SDCI and OSC, are responsible for the deaths from heat stroke that recently have taken place. You Heard from a comment this morning detailing recent articles about excessive heat, which you must have seen, have appeared in National Geographic, New York Times, Seattle Times. Their Loss is especially unfair to communities of color. Why Is SDCI discriminating against them? Yesler Terrace is in the downtown core and suffer unfairly from the heat island effect. Why Is their language in CB 12108, quote, that allows removal of exceptional trees where grading or construction preclude tree retention, unquote. Remove This exception. The Tree canopy potential will take years that the people of Yesler Terrace do not have to wait for life-saving benefits provided by trees. Demand More creative solutions from your builders. We Can&#39;t wait until the end of the year for another quarterly report telling us that another 730 trees, including 65 exceptional trees, are gone. Call For a moratorium on the cutting of exceptional trees. We Need the trees now. You Are to blame for more deaths due to your delay. Thank You, Suzanne. Up Next, we have Jason Rock, followed by June Blue Spruce, and then James Davis. Good Morning, Jason. Hi, Good morning. Thank You, Councilmembers. My Name is Jason. I Live in Columbia City, and I&#39;m a renter. I&#39;m Speaking today to thank Councilmember Mosqueda for asking for the study, the study, the racial justice study, and OPCD for finally releasing the report. I Think this study speaks to a lot of us because it lays bare a disconnect between our city&#39;s ideals and our policies. As We begin the discussion of what the next comprehensive plan policy will look like, it&#39;s important that we understand why and how our current growth strategy has failed to make sure that the next one actually lives up to our ideals by making housing affordable and accessible for everyone. Thanks For your time. Thank You, Jason. Up Next, we have June Blue Spruce, followed by James Davis, and then Judith Benditch. Good Morning, June. Hello. This Is June Blue Spruce. I&#39;m Speaking about the tree update. On June 29th, streets in my neighborhood in southeast Seattle buckled in the heat. Trees Are a critical part of Seattle&#39;s climate change mitigation infrastructure. New Data showed that in King County last summer, temperatures in the warmest and coolest locations differed by more than 23 degrees. And As we know, the people most affected by heat islands are communities of color and areas with the highest environmental health disparities. Unfortunately, Heat and drought are deadly to trees as well. Western Red cedars are dying in increasing numbers. City Bark disease is killing off Seattle street trees, and yet developers and homeowners continue to cut down large numbers of mature trees and tree groves. We Can&#39;t afford to lose trees at this pace. You All must act. Trees Are our climate change vaccine. Don&#39;t Throw them away. Thank You. Thank You, June. Up Next, we have James Davis, followed by Judith Benditch, and then Scott Novotny. I Still see Martha Baskin, Jessica Dixon, Stuart Neven, Janet Way, Patience Malaba, and Emily Herman not present. If You would like to call in, now is the time. James, Good morning. I See you there. You Pressed star six, not pound six. There You are. Hi. Good Morning, council members. My Name is Jim Davis. I Live in district seven. I&#39;m One of the more than 50 people that came to the park overlooking the interbay area to protest the cutting down of 36 trees in a landslide zone right below the park to build two luxury mansions, a 13-car garage and a lap pool. We Could not figure out how this could get approved and discovered the loophole of Seattle municipal code 25.09.29.8. Basically, If a building site existed before October 31st, 1992, no rules apply for development in steep slope hazard areas. This Means that few of our trees in these areas are safe because steep slopes are one of the traditional havens for our large trees. I Would urge the council to take action to close this loophole and not wait for the larger tree ordinance developments to close it. Thank You. Thank You, James. Up Next, we have Judith Benditch, Scott Novotny, followed by David Mooring. Good Morning, Judith. I See you there. Good Morning. Good Morning. Good Morning. This Is Judith Benditch. I Live in Seattle. I&#39;ve Written you many, many letters about trees, so I won&#39;t repeat those. My Major word today is moratorium. Moratorium, Moratorium on any further cutting of exceptional trees that needs to be enacted now. And On tree groves. That Needs to be enacted now. The Only legislation while that moratorium is in effect that I think you should take under consideration and pass is to make the definition of exceptional trees the same one that was used by our speaker from Portland who came in December of 1919. And It&#39;s been that long since you&#39;ve had a presentation on a comprehensive plan and nothing&#39;s been done. The Second issue I wanted to talk about was racial equity. I Also think a moratorium should exist there. The Moratorium should be on any further projects and development in poor neighborhoods that are listed in that you know about where we have where there&#39;s been displacement. The Racial equity report states this. It Needs to stop now because there&#39;s only going to be more displacement and more displacement and more homeless if this continues. Thank You very much. Thank You, Judith. Up Next we have Scott Novotny followed by David Mooring and Rachel Mazur. Scott, Good morning. I Don&#39;t see Scott promoted yet. Scott Is no longer present. Oh. Up Next is David Mooring followed by Rachel Mazur and Chris Lehman. David, Good morning. I See you there, David. There You are. Thank You. Up Next is David Mooring followed by Rachel Mazur and Chris Lehman. David, Good morning. I See you there, David. There You are. Hi. This Is David Mooring. Thank You for the ability to comment. I Have reviewed the presentation that will be presented on tree protection. I Want to bring to everyone&#39;s attention that I think that there is some deceiving numbers. That Being slide 10 shows only 731 tree removals out of 747 permits. The Reason why that is suspect is one, anyone who observes a construction site will see that there is typically more than one tree per property being removed. And Two, if you look at the raw data that some of us have seen, we have seen an average of closer to 11 trees per permit being removed, which would equate to more like 8,000 trees in the City of Seattle during this time period being removed versus just 731. This Is very important, but nevertheless, we do hope that the Department of Construction will work with the Seattle Urban Forestry Commission to make sure that there are no more than 731 trees per permit being removed. And That they also include street trees, parks. Take A look as well. Thank You. If You can send any additional comments, I&#39;m happy to receive those by email and speak further. Up Next, we have Jessica Crossman followed by Rachel Mazur and Chris Lehman. Jessica, Good morning. I See you. There You are. Good Morning. Can You all hear me? I Wanted to speak during the Comprehensive Plan public hearing. Great. We&#39;ll Have you moved over there. Thank You, Jessica. Up Next, we have Rachel Mazur followed by Chris Lehman. I Think that will be it. Okay. I Think that will be it. A Number of these public commenters are signed up for the public hearing. Okay. Do We have any further public commenters? I Believe Chris Lehman is the final commenter for the public comment. Great. Chris, Good morning. I See you there, Chris. You&#39;ll Need to press star six, not pound six. Chris, I see you there, but you&#39;ll need to press star six. All Right. Chris, We&#39;re not seeing you coming off mute. You Need to press star six. I&#39;ll Give you one more time, and then we&#39;re going to move on to the next agenda item. Chris Lehman, one last time. If You could press star six to unmute yourself, we&#39;ll happily take your comments. Hello? There We are, Chris. Good Morning. Take It away. Okay. So I signed up to speak in both hearings, the public comment period and in the hearing. And So for some reason, the Zoom said goodbye and hung up on me before I was allowed to speak in the hearing. So I mean in the public comment period. So Can I make my public comment before the hearing starts? This Is on trees, right, or this is on the committee agenda right now. Mr. Hahn, would you restart the time? Chris, We&#39;re doing one minute right now, and then we&#39;re going to move to the comprehensive plan. Okay. Great. Ready. Take It away. Okay. This Is just I&#39;m speaking in support of all the other comments about the importance of the tree ordinance. But Those in the room, I want to urge you to remain and to support the comprehensive plan amendment that I proposed. It&#39;s A reminder that the tree ordinance is very important, but so is the zoning ordinance. And The zoning ordinance has the setbacks that are inadequate for any large trees in multifamily areas. And The proposal which the city council needs to advance for docketing for study will study looking, improving the comprehensive plan policy regarding that. Otherwise, You know, all of the pluses of trees, the tree ordinance may advocate would not be present because the ordinance would trump them. Thank You, Chris. And We do now have a few other people who have come back present. Martha Baskin-Stewart. And Then I.T. I think that is all public registrants for public comment. So Martha, please take it away. Good Morning. Yes. Good Morning, Martha Baskin. Can You hear me? We Can. Good Morning. All Right. Good Morning to all. Much Of this has already been said, but I&#39;ll just take my less than two minutes. We Can&#39;t fight it in cities by cutting down mature trees. During A crisis, you need all the allies you can get, and trees are natural allies. As Trees grow, they help absorb carbon from the atmosphere, using it as food. Eventually When the tree dies or is cut down, the carbon it&#39;s been storing is released into the atmosphere. The Recent heat wave and reporting on how the lack of mature trees impacts marginalized communities should be addressed. We
Can&#39;t fight at a time of rapid development. Trees Are often cut. Designs Could be altered to retain them. Do These urban clear cuts at least result in affordable housing? No. As Any tree lover or housing observer knows, the loss results in houses with a mean asking price of $765,000. The City&#39;s last tree protection ordinance was written in 2009. Since Then, Seattle Audubon estimates as many as 1,200 acres of canopy have been lost to development. Since The benefits of trees extends beyond the parcels where they stand, this is unacceptable, especially in neighborhoods where the lack of canopy already threatens climate resiliency, environmental equity, and public health. Trees Are community assets, climate and public health assets, just like bridges and roads. They&#39;re Vital infrastructure. Thank You, Martha. Up Next, we have Scott. Good Morning. Good Morning, Stuart. Good Morning. Councilmember Stratton and other councilmembers. Hopefully You can hear me. Yes, We can. Excellent. I&#39;ll Be as quick as I can. I Know you&#39;ve heard many reasons to update tree protection ordinance, so I won&#39;t repeat them, but I will add something that I feel is important to make clear. I Know you&#39;ve heard many reasons to update tree protection ordinance, so I won&#39;t repeat them, but I will add something that I feel is probably a significant issue that is rarely acknowledged and maybe yourself and your colleagues and potentially the majority of Seattle residents don&#39;t realize is the fact that I know you&#39;ve heard many reasons to update tree protection ordinance, so I won&#39;t repeat them, but I will add something that I feel is probably a significant issue that is rarely acknowledged and maybe yourself and your colleagues and potentially the majority of Seattle residents don&#39;t realize is the fact that and wider building and development ordinance, the developers in Seattle currently have more property rights than regular property owners. I Guess to give an example, currently as things stand, you might have two identical adjacent properties, both on which you have 100-year-old house, maybe 10, 100-year-old healthy spruce trees, all exceptional. One Property owner has lived there for 20 years. They Can&#39;t cut down any trees developed by the adjacent property. You Can cut them all down if they claim that the development potential is a lot. Thank You for your comments, and please do feel free to e-mail us and speak in the future as well. I&#39;m Seeing... Is Emily Furman signed up for public comment or the public hearing? Hi. Actually, This is my first time signing up, so thank you for your patience. Wonderful. Take It away. So My name is Emily Furman, and I live at the North Seattle in an area called Pinehurst, which really, if you drive into it, you can experience the feeling of an urban forest. I Live in a property that I do have a responsibility for as an owner, and we have four maples that cover our property and keep it cool, and during the heat wave, that was very important. And In looking at the heat wave and its impact on Seattle, I started looking deeper into climate change and looking at the UN report in 2019 that says in about 11 years, we may have a major challenge in rolling back the impacts of climate change. And That, I&#39;m so sorry, but my son will be 18 at that time, and it is very important that we preserve what we have in Seattle, a quality of life. So I hope, council members, that you take that seriously into consideration. And I would say our trees, like June Blue Spruce said earlier, are a vaccination for our community against climate change. And We can be creative. We Can be creative. We Live in a space that&#39;s 1,100 square feet. We Rent out our bottom floor to low-income housing rates so that we can share our abundance. And We can share our abundance as a city. Thank You. Appreciate Your comment. And We have Jessica Dixon, who has become present. Jessica, Please take it away. Good Morning. Can You hear me? We Can. Good Morning. Hi. My Name is Jessica Dixon. I&#39;m Speaking today as a member of the Plan Amnesty Board and the last 6,000. Two Weeks ago, as people have commented, we suffered an excessive heat wave here in Seattle. At Least 25 people are documented to have died in King County. And Also, a recent Times article, Heat Inequality in King County, describes the maps and analysis revealing our county&#39;s heat islands. The Analysis found that industrial areas and places with dense building concentrated heat while tree canopy mitigated warmth. And Yet, our city planners, and specifically SDCI, ignore the data showing that urban trees are critical in the mitigation of the heat island effect, and continue to allow development and the ensuing removal of significant tree canopy and understory in our city, especially on our environmentally critical areas. City Planners, I am submitting comments documenting two sites, one in South Seattle in a riparian ECA, and one in North Seattle in a steep slope ECA. I&#39;m Asking why the city is not walking the talk when it comes to combating climate change, and why one of our last havens for large trees, which confer so many benefits to the public, our ECA&#39;s, are not being protected by our city. Thank You. And We do now have Patience Malaba present. We Have Janet Way and Scott Novotny not present. And That will conclude our list here. Good Morning, Patience. Hello, Can you hear me? We Can. Good Morning. Thank You, Chair Stroud. I Am Patience Malaba with the Housing Development Consortium of Seattle King County. I Want to express my gratitude to RPCD for the release of the long-awaited Cross-Strategy Racial Equity Toolkit Report and the Community Engagement Report. Special Thanks to Councilmember Mosqueda for requesting the study and continuing to advocate for the release of this report. The Reports are insightful, illuminating, and quite frankly, confirm what we already know and have been saying for some time. The Urban Village Cross-Strategy has been perpetuating a historical pattern of exclusionary zoning. The Political and protectionist language of single-family home ownership that shaped the Urban Village Cross-Strategy was baked into our comprehensive plan iterations and has devastating impacts on BIPOC communities. And I think recognizing the impact is the first step in building a new vision for the city is going to be one where we can deliver systemic change and racial equity. So Thank you for your leadership on this work and look forward to partnering with you on advancing a comprehensive plan update that delivers equitable growth. Thank You. Thank You. Thank You, Patience. Janet Wei, Scott Novotny, last call. IT, Can you confirm that they are not present? They Are not present. Thank You. Seeing As we have no additional speakers remotely present, we will move on to the next agenda item. I Will take our first agenda item in order on the agenda, which is the comprehensive plan briefing and public hearing. I Will ask you to keep your questions and comments to the end of the presentation. And Please, at this time, limit your questions and comments unless it is quite necessary. We Will be hearing this again in two weeks at our next committee hearing. And We have two presentations that I think are going to take a lot of our attention. So Please limit your comments as needed and save your questions and comments at the end of the presentation. So Our first item of business today is a briefing and public hearing on the comprehensive plan docketing resolution. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the item into the record? Agenda Item 1, 2021-2022, comprehensive plan amendment docket setting resolution. Thank You. We&#39;re Joined by Lish Whitson of Council Central staff, as well as Executive Director Vanessa Murdoch and Co-Chair Rick Moeller of the Seattle Planning Commission. Lish, Would you kick us off and welcome Vanessa and Rick? Thank You, and good morning. I&#39;m Going to share a PowerPoint. There We are. I Hope you can see that. So We&#39;re talking this morning about the 2021-2022 comprehensive plan docket. As A reminder, under state law, the comp plan can only be amended once a year. So We use the docket setting process to collect all of the amendments that council may want to consider in a year and analyze them together. The Process involves a call for amendments in the spring. In The summer, now, we review the amendment applications and receive recommendations from the Planning Commission, OPCD, to establish the docket of items that will be considered further. In The fall, OPCD reviews the amendments, conducts environmental review, and makes recommendations by the end of the year. And Then the following winter, so next winter, the council ideally receives recommendations from OPCD and considers the amendments. Council Has adopted a set of criteria that are used to judge whether or not it&#39;s appropriate to docket a comprehensive plan amendment. They Include topics, questions like, is the amendment legal under state and local law? Is It appropriate for the comp plan or is it better addressed in some other way? Is It practical to consider the amendment? Do We have staff capacity? Will It require a multiple-year process? We Do receive amendments that have been submitted in the past, and we ask the proposer to identify changed circumstances that would merit reconsidering those docketed amendments. For Amendments that would amend neighborhood plans, we ask that there be outreach to the neighborhood with that plan. We Want to make sure that there is likely to be an actual difference in change as a result of the amendments that are being proposed. And Finally, for changes proposed to the future land use map, which is a general picture of the future organization of uses across the city, that map is intended to be a general map that shows a general distribution of uses. It&#39;s Not supposed to be a specific parcel-by-parcel map of uses on each lot in the city. And So there&#39;s a size threshold that we use. And Generally, if an amendment to the map is consistent with the map, it doesn&#39;t require a future land use map amendment. This Year, we&#39;ve received seven amendments. Central Staff and the Planning Commission have reviewed them and are recommending that one move forward for further consideration. That&#39;s Amendment 1, which is a proposal from Councilmember Lewis to reclassify Florencia Street on the north side of Queen Anne Hill from arterial designation to a non-arterial designation. Amendment 2 is a proposed amendment to the future land use map. This Doesn&#39;t meet the size thresholds that are laid out in the criteria, and so does not meet the criteria for docketing. Amendment 3 is also an amendment to the future land use map. This Is an amendment to an area in the Ballard-Enterbay North End Manufacturing Industrial Center. This Also doesn&#39;t meet the size criteria, but also it&#39;s adjacent to property that is going to be studied as part of the follow-up environmental impact statement for the manufacturing industrial stakeholder process that the mayor&#39;s office just concluded. And So consideration of future uses on this site is probably better considered in the context of that broader work. We Have four amendments that have been proposed in the past and have been proposed again without an indication of significant change circumstances that would merit the council opening them up again. But Just to briefly walk through them, the setbacks and trees item, council asked OPCD to look at that in the context of broader consideration of trees. OPCD Will have recommendations related to that amendment. They&#39;ve Published those recommendations in the last couple weeks and will be back in September. So That&#39;s already under consideration, been analyzed. Sky Bridges, trams, and tunnels is better addressed through our current code provisions that provide detailed guidance on where sky bridges and tunnels and other significant structures in the right-of-way are appropriate. The Open and democratic government proposal would add a new element to the comp plan. Adding A new element is a major undertaking and is best suited to the major update to the comp plan, and we haven&#39;t ever added a new element during an annual process. And The last item is heavy vehicles, which proposes a fee or charge for heavy vehicles, and that&#39;s better addressed through other means. We Don&#39;t call out fees and charges in our comprehensive plan, but rather through the municipal code. Attached To the memo that Eric McConaghy and I have drafted is a draft resolution. In Addition to item one, which is proposed to be docketed, it lists these five items that have been docketed in the past and work still needs to be completed. Designation Of the South Park urban village and analysis of whether or not that village meets the criteria OPCD is proposing to consider as part of the next major update. You Will see some initial amendments related to potential future urban village at 130th and I-5 this September. But There will be additional work that needs to happen after that first round of changes. OPCD Is recommending, continues to recommend considering amendments related to fossil fuels and public health as part of the next major update. You&#39;ll See some initial amendments related to maritime and industrial lands policies in September, but there is currently a scoping process for an EIS that will lead to broader changes to maritime industrial lands policies. And So that continues to be on the docket. And The council continues to consider impact fee amendments. And Just for your understanding, the 130th I-5 study area. And That&#39;s it. Any Questions? Thank You, Lish. And Vanessa, Rick, do you have anything to share? Understanding You&#39;ll be back with us at the next committee meeting as well. Thank You, Chair Strauss. This Is Vanessa Murdoch, staff to the commission. I Have nothing to add. As You&#39;ll see in the memo that Lish and Eric provided, our recommendations are consistent with that of central staff. Rick, Do you have anything to add? Vanessa, Thank you, Chair Strauss. No, I have nothing to add either. Thanks, Rick. Thank You, Vanessa. Amendment 1, Florencia Street, Council Member Lewis. I Believe you are supporting this amendment. Would You like to speak to it now? If You do, remember, we do have another committee meeting next time to speak on this. Yeah, I&#39;m happy to speak to it now and at the next committee meeting. I&#39;m Really, really excited to see this moving forward and see this space on Florencia get reclaimed for more equitable access for pedestrians and bicyclists. This Has been a very common complaint from residents from the time that I was doorbelling here during my campaign and in the office from residents who have been concerned about the safety hazards posed by cars that respond to the incentives on the street and really speed through the zone that is completely flanked by a lot of residential houses. And, You know, this is really a great opportunity to demonstrate how an arterial that is positioned like this can be a much better neighborhood asset if we return it back to the neighborhood and turn it into more of a local residential street. So I&#39;m really looking forward to this. This Is the first step. I&#39;m A little disappointed that making a change like this requires going through the entire comprehensive plan process. I Understand it. I Appreciate very much the staff time that&#39;s gone into getting this ready and just want to give a shout out to Calvin and Lish for all of the great work that they&#39;ve done with me throughout this process. Want To give a shout out to the neighbors who have been organizing around Florencia for this change for many years. And I&#39;m really excited that we can see this move forward. So Thank you for giving us some time and space to consider this. Chairman Strauss and I look forward to advancing this over the next several weeks. Great. Thank You, Councilmember Lewis. And Lastly, recognizing the impact that historic land use decisions have had on so many communities, especially the construction of highways throughout our city. I Am curious if we can docket an item considering adding language about reconnecting communities across highways to make clear that highway lids and other connections are consistent with the comprehensive plan. Is This possible that we can bring forward before the next committee hearing, Lish? Yeah, I&#39;ll work with you and your staff to figure out the appropriate language. Great. I&#39;ll Save more comments for next time. Colleagues, Are there any other questions before we open up the public hearing? Nope. No Other questions. Before We open the remote public hearing, I would again ask that everyone please be patient as we continue to learn to operate this new system in real time and navigate through the inevitable growing pains. We Are continuously looking for ways to fine-tune this process and adding new features to allow for additional means of public participation in our council meetings. I Will moderate the public hearing in the following manner. Each Speaker will be given two minutes to speak since we only have three speakers. I Will call on one speaker at a time and in the order in which they registered on the council&#39;s website. If You have not yet registered to speak and would like to, you can sign up before the end of this public hearing by going to the council&#39;s website at seattle.gov forward slash council.

Thank You. With The public hearing on the comprehensive docket setting resolution is now open. We Will begin with the first speaker on the list. We Have three speakers present today. Jessica Clausen, Rachel Mazur, and Chris Lehman. Good Morning, Jessica. Thank You for having me. My Name is Jessica Clausen. I&#39;m Here representing many industrial owners in both the Duwamish MEC and in the BNMEC and I&#39;m speaking today to the manufacturing industrial recommendations forwarded by OPCB. The Mayor&#39;s recommended crop plan amendment to stop any property from being taken out of industrial is premature and out of sequence. We Ask the council to delay consideration of it until it can look at the industrial policies holistically. You All know we have a lot going on in land use and transportation planning right now. Sound Transit has yet to decide the alignment for its Ballard and West Seattle links and these links go right through both the Duwamish and the BNMEC. Why Would council docket and study a crop plan amendment now that may make it more difficult to consider these really important transportation decisions when making land use changes? Council Should wait until the EIS is done on the industrial policies and council has this information in front of it before it considers the amendment. We&#39;re Also concerned about the piecemeal SEPA review of this amendment. It&#39;s Inextricably linked to the maritime industrial policies that were determined to require an EIS. Yet This amendment has, for some reason, OPCB has determined that it has determination of non-significance, which we don&#39;t think is correct. There&#39;s Also concern that this amendment is not consistent with PSRC&#39;s Vision 2050 policies or King County&#39;s countywide planning policies and as a result are non-compliant with the Growth Management Act. We Would ask that you don&#39;t docket this premature amendment and that you would wait until you can make your policy decisions on industrial policy as a whole so we can get to the good business of planning for land use around transportation nodes appropriately. Thank You. Thank You, Jessica. Up Next is Rachel Mazur, followed by Chris Lehman. Rachel, Good morning. Good Morning, council members. My Name is Rachel Mazur. I&#39;m An attorney representing the applicant Jeffrey Hummel. So The time is now for the council to study the amendment proposal for West Armory Way. This Amendment would change two parcels in Interbay from bin-mixed commercial slash mixed-use. Interbay Is a neighborhood slated for a light rail line and it&#39;s also no longer predominantly in industrial use. The Property owner intends to redevelop the property into affordable workforce housing. As You know, we are in the middle of a housing crisis and the property owner is willing to agree to a covenant guaranteeing affordability levels for the life of the affordable housing project. Therefore, We respectfully request that the council study this amendment. Thanks So much. Thank You, Rachel. Up Next is Chris Lehman. Chris, Good morning again. Hello. I Request, council member, before my two minutes start, could I ask you to please, given that there&#39;s no one testifying, you have the discretion to permit me to speak for two minutes on each of the four, each of the four amendments, detailed amendments. And You are arbitrarily refusing to allow discussion that really is substantive. Okay. So Will you allow two minutes per amendment? Your Timer has now begun, Mr. Lehman. Will You please answer? No, You will have the same time allotted to all individuals. Okay. Well, As usual, as usual, forgive me, as usual, the council is being very high handed and arbitrary and capricious. The Only amendment you&#39;re advancing is a friendly amendment from a fellow council member. You&#39;re Not taking seriously the proposals from the public. Your Staff has failed to address the actual recent changes addressed in my application and even since then that require each of these to be studied. The Heat islands that kills people are significantly caused by the lack of large trees and the multifamily zoning doesn&#39;t permit large trees anymore. That&#39;s Number four. Number Five, the skybridge policy is inconsistent because it has a good policy for downtown and one urban village, but it just needs to be extended to all of the urban villages. Under Number six, the city has been operating under an emergency with very, very poor outreach and democratic processes during the coronavirus crisis. I Propose some improvements. That Is a very significant need and the city needs to study whether it&#39;s going to be desirable to have an appendix or a new element. That Can be decided later, but don&#39;t refuse to study something that&#39;s important. Finally, The west Seattle bridge&#39;s destruction has been acknowledged as being partly caused by extra heavy vehicles, most of which, according to an SDOT study that I revealed for you, is mostly caused by city-owned and county-owned vehicles or chartered vehicles by the city and county. Thank You, Mr. Lehman. That Was our last speaker remotely present. Sorry, That was the last speaker remotely present to speak at this public hearing. The Public hearing on the comprehensive plan docket setting resolution is now closed. Thank You to everyone who provided comments today. This Docketing resolution should be formally introduced on July 26th, informed by the discussion today and at the public hearing. We Will plan to vote on the resolution on our July 28th meeting and Mr. Lehman, I know that staff from my office have spoken with you outside of public comment as well. Colleagues, Any other questions? I Would love to move us along. Nope. Thank You, Council Member Juarez. As Always, our next item of business today is a briefing and discussion of the racial equity analysis on the comprehensive plan and urban village strategy. Mr. Ahn, will you please read this item into the record? Agenda Item two, growth strategy, racial equity toolkit report. Thank You. We Are joined by Director Rico Quirendongo and Michael Hubner of OPCD for this presentation. I Know that Director Quirendongo needs to leave in 25 minutes, so colleagues, please do feel free to ask questions along the way. Director Michael, please take it away. Thank You. We Might ask Noah Ahn to share his screen, but Noah, I&#39;m going to go ahead and share the slides from my end, so no need to do that, and I&#39;ll turn it over to my Interim Director Rico Quirendongo while we do that. Thank You. Thank You, Michael. Thank You, Council Member Strauss. I Know that this presentation and report and discussion has been anticipated for some time, and we&#39;re very excited to be here and happy to be able to deliver the report. As Michael will share as we get into his presentation material, this is just the very, very first step of a huge body of work that we will need to move into with a comprehensive plan, a major update. And So I think this is an important first step, but it&#39;s just the beginning of a much larger effort and conversation. With That, I&#39;m going to turn it over to Mr. Huebner. Take It away. Bear With me here. There We go. So Thank you, Mr. Chair, Council Members. Thank You very much for having us here today. It Is, in particular, very apt and important that we begin the comprehensive plan update process, which is a several year process reviewing this important body of work. I Am going to go through the slides relatively quickly to allow time for Executive Director Kirandongo to be here to take some of your questions, but do feel free to, if there are pressing questions for clarity along the way, let us know. So, First of all, some grounding in the comprehensive plan. This Is a 20 year plan that guides how the city grows. It Covers land use, the location and density of new development, housing and for employment, infrastructure and services, policies on housing and economic development, really shaping so many aspects of what the city does over time in setting high level policy, but also sets a vision for the city&#39;s future guided by four core values in the current plan. Racial And social equity, environmental stewardship, community and economic opportunity and security. The Plan is a requirement of the State Growth Management Act, and we are required as a city to update that plan with the next update due in 2024, and that happens once every eight years. As An early step in the comp plan update process, we conducted this racial equity analysis. This Has been noted a response to a slide from the budget cycle of a couple of years ago. A Couple of things that happened in the interim were the state changing the deadline for the comprehensive plan update from 2023 to 2024. And With us poised to launch the update of the comprehensive plan later this year, the release of this report is timed to be the first step as we move toward beginning the planning process in late 2021. This Is a look back at the current comprehensive plan, really asking some foundational questions about whether the plan is living up to its stated promise. Asking Questions about who benefits and who is harmed by the growth that&#39;s happening in the city as shaped by the plan, and how can the comprehensive plan update be improved to achieve more equitable racial outcomes going forward. To Do this work, we thought it was extremely important to bring in an independent perspective, and we selected PolicyLink, which is a national nonprofit with expertise in equitable public policy. PolicyLink Worked with the city when we last updated our plan in 2014-2015, so this was an opportunity for them to follow up with us and provide assistance as we take on the next update and starting that process before we even begin or launch the work with the community or our own analysis and policy development. So This is foundational, both in setting the scope for the update, but also setting us up for a racial equity toolkit, which is a more formalized, more deeper, and broader public engagement process, which addresses many of the racial disparities that we will be covering today. As I mentioned, the update process is a several-year process. We Are currently in the first year of that process, which is mostly about project planning and setting the scope for the work that we&#39;re going to ramp up later this year. The Racial equity analysis is part of that pre-work. As We move toward a more intensive period of planning and policy development later this year and into 2022, that work will be informed by outreach to stakeholders and neighborhoods citywide, with priority engagements by PAC communities, responsiveness to state law and regional policies and targets, and also data and analysis, including an environmental impact statement that we anticipate will be needed under the State Environmental Policy Act. There Are two primary deliverables from this process. One Is a community engagement report. I&#39;ll
It is 9:31 A.M. Will the clerk please call the roll. Council member Lewis. Present. Council member. Present. Council member. Present. Chair Strauss. Present. Five present. Okay. The land use and neighborhoods committee of the city of Seattle begin our--because this is the land use committee. This is not intended to give us permission to do as we please after acknowledging. It is a moment of reflection so we will take a pause and start with our land acknowledgment. We begin by acknowledging we are on the traditional and ancestral lands of the first people of this region past and present. Again we start with this acknowledgment to recognize the fact we are guests on this land and must steward our guests as such, as guests. We most ensure we are Stewarding our land and work as the guests we are, as our time here is short. Thank you. We have four items on the agenda today. Public hearing on the proposed comprehensive plan amendment to address the up--to update the name of single family zones to neighborhood residential. We have a briefing and discussion on Council bill 120121. Also we will have a public hearing and vote on Council bill 120108. Finally we will have a resolution on resolution 32010. The next meeting will be on Wednesday August 11th starting at 9:30 A.M. Before we begin if there is no objection, the agenda will be adopted. Hearing no objection the agenda is adopted. This morning we are having a public comment and a public hearing. If you are a--if you are signed up for public comment you must be addressing the item on today&#39;s agenda. This is not a stance I have been firm with since I first took office. So I see a number of people are signed up to discuss issues not on the agenda or in the land use and neighborhoods committee namely West green Lake way North which many people have already heard my stance which we need to reopen the road with a two Lane protected bike Lane on the Lake side of the road. This can be done immediately and we shouldn&#39;t be waiting months to do so. For folks who are signed up for public comment to testify about West green Lake way North while I agree with you, this is not the appropriate place for these public comments. I will be attending a neighborhood Awes Souation in the and green Lake community council meeting tonight where is the appropriate place to discuss this topic. At this time we will begin to open the remote public comment period for the items on today&#39;s agenda. Before we begin I ask that everyone please be patient as we learn to operate this new system. While it remains our strong intent to have public comment regularly included, the city council reserves the right to end or eliminate this public comment period at any point if we deem the system is being abused or is unsuitable to allow our meetings to be conducted efficiently. The public comment period is up to 10 minutes. Each Speaker will be given one minute to speak. We have about 30 people signed up for public comment and public hearing. I will call on each Speaker by name and in the order of which they registered on the Website. If you have not yet registered to speak and would like to you can seen up before the end of public comment by going to the Council&#39;s Website. Once I call on the Speaker&#39;s name, staff Lynn--will Unmute the appropriate microphone. Please begin by stating your name and the item on the agenda in which you are addressing. Speakers will hear a Chime when ten seconds are left of the a Lotted time. If the Speaker does not end their public comments at the end of the a Lotted time provided the microphone be will be Unmuted to allow us to call on the next Speaker. Again there is a separate public hearing for item 1 the proposed residential name change and for item 3 Council bill 121018. If you wish to speak about those items, please sign up for the appropriate public comment public Hahher hearing. The public comment period is now open. Can iron firm the folks in yellow from for the public hearing. Is that correct? That is correct. Great. If you are here to speak about West green Lake way North, this is not the appropriate place. Please do keep your comments focused on today&#39;s agenda items. Good morning. It appears to be an error. Sorry. She is not present? That is correct. Next is Blair. Good morning, Blair. . that appears to be an error, too, I&#39;m sorry. Okay. Sylvia Stewart, are you with us? Sylvia Stewart. I&#39;m here. Hi Sylvia I was originally signed up for green Lake but I have some--well I don&#39;t agree with changing the zoning from single family to the neighborhood whatever. Um, I think we should still have single family areas in the city and I realize we have to let other people be more dense and stuff like that but I feel like our city is special and we don&#39;t have to do it like Chicago, like New York and we don&#39;t have to just up zone and let developers have a hay day and build whatever they want anywhere. What we should do if we are going to keep our city beautiful is get some architects to look at each neighborhood in a fashion and find out what are the best--keeping the characters of that neighborhood, where are the best places to up Sxoen how could we do this in a way we keep our city beautiful for years to come and still save some single family areas which have the tree canopy and everything like that. And do it that way. Don&#39;t do it like--you don&#39;t have to do it like other cities do it or create sprawl or whatever. Do it in a Seattle way. That is my comment. Thank you, Sylvia. Up next we have Elizabeth and Rachel. I see we have Elizabeth here to speak about West green Lake North. Again this is not the appropriate Committee for that comment. Elizabeth, are you with us? Yes, I am now. I&#39;m sorry. I think I missed what you said but I think you don&#39;t want us to talk about the Rvs taking up parking. This is not the select homelessness committee or the Trarns Pooration committee or the parks committee. This is the land use committee. If there is an item you would like to speak about. Well the road closure. The road closure around green Lake. This is not the correct committee. There will be a meeting tonight though I will be attending. Oh, okay. I&#39;m sorry. Social media somebody--somebody recommended me to talk about the use of that road. Okay. I will see you tonight. Thanks. Bye. Clerk or--Mr. G, can--are there no further public commentators signed up? As far as I can tell, I believe it is all public hearing. Great. Thank you. Seeing as we have no additional speakers remotely present, we will move on to the next agenda item. And Mr.--will you please read--or I guess our first item of business is a public hearing on the proposed comprehensive plan amendment to update the name. Will you please read the short title of this into the record? Agenda item one, pro Prosed comprehensive plan amendment for neighborhood residential areas. Can you provide a brief over view? Sure. Happy to provide that over view. Good morning. The proposed legislation is attached to my memo which is attached to the agenda. It propose as number of amendments the comprehensive plan to shift the name of what are currently called single family residential areas to neighborhood residential areas. Changes would be made to the land use housing and 17 neighborhood plans where the term single family residential area shows up and replace those references with neighborhood residential. The idea is to recognize that--these are areas that have broader set of land uses than just single family detached homes. They are the places where we have most of our parks in opened spaces. They are where most of our schools are located and they also--have multi-family uses in them. For example the residential small lot zone which is classified as a single family residential area is a zone that allows townhouses and apartments as well as single family detached homes. The idea is to better reflect the character of those areas to day and to size up for a conversation about the future use of those areas as part of the next major update to the plan. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions. Thank you Mr. Whitson. I&#39;m pleased to be Co-Sponsoring this amendment with Council member Mosqueda. I believe that language really does matter. [Indiscernible] I know in my neighborhood there are many Duplexes that are now in single family zones that could not be Fwoilt day that reflect the character of our neighborhood and provide for that meaningful density of having more people. While this is--can you please confirm this is just a name change and we are not adjusting policy today. Is that correct? That is correct. I realized I forgot answer the second part of your initial question. The intent is to enter this legislation after this public hearing, bring it to the committee in September for consideration along side other amendments proposed by the Mayor. And it would be followed by potential amendments to the land use code following adoption of the complaint. Thank you. Do you have anything you would like share at this time? Thank you very much, Mr. chair. Appreciate the opportunity to work with you and your leadership and Co-Sponsorship and legislation. Thank you for the outline and your detailed analysis of the proposal in front of us. I want to thank you Mr. chair for the words you used. You are right. Language matters and this is an update to the name. This legislation constitutes a technical change. Has legacy, it has roots and zoning practices. Also the great work of Opcd and their team along with partners. I think that that has been well covered document and appreciate the Seattle times coverage of it yesterday. I think what we are trying to do with this legislation here is a very narrow change recognizes we need a more inclusive, more accurate name such as neighborhood residential or perhaps neighborhood family residential. We will hear more today to help recognize that these neighborhoods are already home to diverse housing types. Diverse housing types built before we increasingly shrunk the area where Seattle could build multi-family structures and we want to make sure as Lish noted that there is already diverse types around so we are having a name that truly recognized our fabric of our city needs to be representative of more than just single family only. The single family only designation does not reflect the current make up. We have Duplexes and Row houses in the apartment I used to live in that is zoned as single family only. We need a more accurate name than the one that has been with us since 1994. We I think are on a path to help make sure language is inclusive and we are reflecting the diverse make up of the community and we begin this conversation about how we both address the zoning policies needed along with Anti-Displacement strategies. I believe the timing is right for this proposal. I am not sure if folks have the chance to review back to the 2018 planning Commission reports. Every year they have been asking the city to act on the recommendation and to change the name of single family only to more appropriately create a--title that is more reflective of our zoning and they have requested this in anticipation of the comprehensive plan update. Since 2018 the city Council has requested this change to the inclusive of the annual comprehensive amendments proposed by the executive. We are drawing from these repeated requests and the support--broad support from community--[Indiscernible] I am very proud to be working with you, Mr. chair, on this legislation and want to thank the community organizations who have been asking for something like this including the community housing Roundtables which we convene quarterly members--[Indiscernible] folks who have been working with and led by community members and serving community members. There is a letter of nearly 400 individuals and organizations who are within communities within the 17 neighborhoods whose neighborhood plan is currently using the term single family that would potentially be affected who have written in in support and we have had a conversation with folks in the community Association last week. We spoke with members from Highland park. We are happy to virtually attend any community meeting and talk more about the proposal to make sure folks understand the narrow scope of this legislation. The importance from the historical perspective and why it is important to I think address both fears about displacement and development we can do that when we have a document that more accurately reflects the fabric of our neighborhoods so we can begin a conversation from a more inclusive place. Mr. chair I would like to thank them for their support for this effort along with the housing development, Seattle South side Chamber of Commerce, and the other 60 E-Mails we have received in support of this effort here today. We want to do the most we can to educate our community about why this narrow piece is important at this time in the process. Thank you, Mr. chair. I appreciate you highlighting the fact a number of times is very narrow in scope that this is a name change only and does not change policy and while this is a small step in and changing a name will not solve all the problems, using a more inclusive name reflects the reality on the ground and does move us in the right--right direction. Any other question before we open public comment? I want to say your team has been tremendous as well along with Lish. Thank you so much. I know they have done a tremendous amount of research on this topic along with you as well, Mr. chair. Thank you. We have nearly 30 people signed up for public comment. We will limit comment to one minute. Before we--open the remote public hearing I would ask that everyone please be patient as we don&#39;t learn and operate the system--this new system Realtime and navigate through the growing pains. We are looking for ways to fine tune this process and adding new features. I will moderate the public hearing in the following manner. Each Speaker will be given one minute to speak. I will call on one Speaker at time and in the order in which you guys enrolled on the Website. The link also listed on today&#39;s agenda. Once I call on a name, staff will Unmute the microphone. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item you are addressing. As a reminder public comment should relate to the comprehensive plan process. If you have comments about something not on today&#39;s agenda you can always provide written comment by E-Mailing my office. Speakers will hear a Chime when 10 seconds are left of your a Lotted time. Once you hear the Chime we ask you to begin wrapping up your comments. If speakers do not end their comments by the end of the a Lotted time the Speaker&#39;s Moo are phone will be muted to allow us to call on the next Speaker. Once you have completed your public comment we ask you please Disconnect from the line. If you plan to continue following the meeting please do so. Public hearing is now open. We will begin by calling on the speakers on the list. I have Calvin Jones followed by Chase, Alice, Laura. We will start with Calvin. Good morning, Calvin. Good morning. Hi everybody. I&#39;m Calvin Jones. I am here today to speak in support of the proposed rename from single family to neighborhood residential. Today over 70% of our city&#39;s residential land is reserved. This encourages sprawl and ensures our best public amenities disproportionately benefit wealthy white residents. I think building a sustainable and equitable city Requirestous be more welcoming. Language does matter. I look forward to the name change. I look forward to making our city more welcoming. I also am hoping to see more significantly more progressive taxes to fund affordable housing. Thank you for being such strong champions on this issue. Thank you. Next we have Chase followed by brad, Rob explain then Alice. Good morning. Good morning. I am here on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce. I am here to speak in support of changing the name of single family areas to neighborhood residential areas. We want to thank the council member for bringing this forward and chair Strauss for Co-Sponsoring. The name single family is not reflective of the neighborhoods we have today. Many single family areas have multiple city dwellings that were constructed before. Seattle must take action. We stand ready to work with Council and the city to ensure Seattle continues to make changes to promote density so Seattle has more housing of all types which is vital to the competitive, equitable and inclusive economy chamber works toward. Thank you. Up next is brad followed by Rob explain then Alice. Good morning, brad. Are you with us, brad? I see you there. Press Star 6, not pound 6. Star 6. It should come off mute. All right. Can you hear me now? We can. Good morning. Sorry about that. Technical Glitch. Good morning. My name is Bradley. I am a past president of the eye of Seattle and an active advocate in the city for urban I wanted to speak in support of the that name change. I believe this will help the city of Seattle begin to address the long standing issues of equity, race and social justice within our current zoning limitations. I agree with many of the specifics identified. A few allow for greater range of housing types given the challenges we have today in our city. I also want to propose that we look beyond this to the future and hope to see fantastic efforts from the Council and our community. Building more efforts towards Inkwlusive communities. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning Robin. Hi. My name is Robin. Good morning. I am calling in to ask for your support for the Noim change. The new name will reflect our goal to this area and is a first step to lining the zoning more closely with our values of the community. I look forward to future changes and thank you for allowing me to speak. Thank you, Robin. Up next we have Alice followed by Laura and then on deck patience. Alice, good morning. Good morning. I&#39;m Alice from 350 Seattle. We wholeheartedly welcome the change to neighborhood residential and the conversation that will follow. We have several hopes for this conversation. We urge that the plan leverage the findings and recommendations of the recently released racial equity analysis of the Seattle 2035 comprehensive plan in an urban village strategy and also a racial equity tool kit for this COMP plan update. The urban village strategy led to huge development pressure in our city&#39;s neighborhoods while preserving Exclusionary zoning in the suburbs we call single family zones. And has exacerbated wealth and inequality. This has led to a huge wave of displacement. The update must be done on concert with hard work to address these harms. Secondly we urge everyone involved to think Inclusively about the term neighborhood residential. Everyone from the Council President to the Mayor is on board with the term 15 minute neighborhoods which are transit, dense -- Thank you, Alice. Please feel free to send in any additional comments. Good morning. What happened in Seattle impacts cities across the country. A small issue might seem insignificant to many. What it Indicateds is we are finally willing to admit that the type of protectionism that has long been the rule of land use communities is shifting. Listening to comments is income Pantable with climate friendly cities. It is at the extent of Renters. Please support the neighborhood residential change and also support deep Anti-Displacement. Thank you Chlt. Patience. Good morning. Good morning. I&#39;m with the housing development chair of Seattle King County. I am calling to express our support for the name change of single family zoning to neighborhood residential. [Indiscernible] I am thrilled you are moving forward with this proposal. It recognizes the problem with the name goes deeper than being misrepresented. Single family zoning has never been a neutral planning tool. We are laying the ground work to create more opportunities for day direct housing. I thank you for your leadership on this very important. Thank you. Up next sow 1Y followed by James and then Jasmine. Zoey, good morning. I see you there, Zoey. Press Star 6. Not pound 6. Uh still see you there. If you press Star 6 you will Unmute yourself. Give it one more try and we will come back to you. You are there. Press Star 6. We will come back to Zoey. Up next we have Jaime followed by Jasmine. I see you there. Good morning. The Seattle planning Commission appreciates the opportunity. This change will provide these areas with more accurate title that better reflects the diversity of households now living with them and will provide an important first step towards making these areas more equitable and accessible. [Indiscernible]. Thank you. Up next we have Jasmine Smith followed by Alex and matt. Jasmine, good morning. I see you there. Hello. I hear you. I&#39;m calling in support of the name change for neighbor has residential. I&#39;m a Renter who serves on the community Council that is speaking for myself today. I can&#39;t wait for the name to reflect the housing options that already exist. The plan must take action to allow policy changes in our zoning system and strong Anti-Displacement strategies to show a deep commitment to racial equity. Communities have suffered. The urban village strategy is perpetuating a pattern. I can&#39;t wait to change the name and further down road change the zoning itself. Thank you. Thank you. Up next we have Zoey Jenkins. Is she still with us? Lets give her one more try. There you are. I see you are Unmuted, Zoey. My apologies. My name is Zoey Jenkins. I am addressing the single family zone item. I&#39;m a resident. I would suggest the term single household instead which is more inclusive language. Residential neighborhoods can lead to a lot of growth and Multiplex structures. These tend to be large three story Plat exterior wall structures. There is a severe loss of trees and light and space when they occur. We don&#39;t have a power grid to support more density as we already know. So lets help our small businesses grow. Let&#39;s help our big businesses develop salt Lites into the neighboring communities. Lets help people who need jobs lets help everyone in the King County region have growth and stability rather than over--dense guy Seattle. If I Seattle. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. Can you hear me? We can. Good morning. Great. Thank you. I&#39;m the executive director of future wise. I&#39;m here to comment in support of the name change to neighborhood residential. There are two reasons I want to highlight. I think this is an important step towards getting the city out of the business of defining who is a family. For many of us biology and a marriage license are not the only things that hold our families together. This would bring Seattle more in line with new state law under Senate bill 5325. I&#39;m also in support of this change because I think it sets the stage for a city wide conversation act how our neighborhood residential areas can better meet our city&#39;s housing needs and address the history of race and cost based exclusion this parts of the city. Thank you. Up next we have matt followed by Rick and Ryan is on deck. . Hello. I hear you. Hi. Yes, great. My name is matt Hutchins. It is year try mate Chienl is here. It is clear we have been losing ground. It is clear our current planning strategies are Disadvantaging communities, opening up Gentrification. We are fuelling these Phenomenons. We have a land use code stuck in the past. We are asking--if we can switch out these words we will be well on our way to creating a more diverse welcomed neighborhood. Thank you. Up next we have Rick followed by Ryan and Aaron on deck. [Indiscernible] Sorry. This would not--that would be for public comment. Okay. We will--um--address that at the end of this public hearing. Up next we have Rick. If you would like to begin, Rick. Good morning. Yes. Good morning. My name is Rick and I&#39;m speaking as Co-Chair of the Seattle planning Commission following up on comments made by Jaime earlier. In addition to Jaime&#39;s comments the Seattle planning Commission would like to note that while the name change from single family to neighborhood residential is modest, it is an important step that accurately frames neighborhood residential areas as having a variety of building types welcoming a diversity of residents with a broad range of household configurations. The planning Commission supports this and thanks Council members for their work on this important issue. Thanks. Thank you, Rick. Ryan, if you would like to speak to this proposed name change you are welcomed to. We can also open public comment at the end. I see you there Ryan B if you want to come off mute. Ryan if you could press Star 6. One last call, Ryan if you want to press Star 6, not pound 6. We will move on and come back to you at the end. I see you are not present. The next set is Alicia Ruiz followed by Deb Barker although Deb you are not present. James I also see you are here for resolution 321010. Alicia, good morning. Good morning. Good morning. My name is Alicia Ruiz. I&#39;m the government affairs manager of King County. I&#39;m here today in full support of the proposed comprehensive plan amendment that changes the name of the single family zone to the more inclusive name of the neighborhood residential zone. It is an important move forward to support more day--Diversive and equitable neighborhoods. I also believe this is a critical step forward in--[Indiscernible] Are you still with us, Alicia? We have lost the caller. If you--if you want to send in your public comments, please do so. Deb I see you are not present. Up next is Doug followed by James and then Trayvon fields. I see you are not present. And also not sure if this is the correct Committee for your comments. We will get to that when we get to it. Good morning. Good morning. My name is Doug. The pace of which Seattle can be displaced is lightning quick. All it takes is a life emergency. The pace at which we change our zoning plan is slow. It has been six years. I applaud Council member Mosqueda for restarting this conversation and commissioning the racial equity tool kit on the strategy. The findings of that study were striking and Unam Biggous. It is accelerating the displacement of black and Brown people from our city. It is not compatible with solutions. Zoning isn&#39;t the only barrier. We need to turn a new leaf. Lets follow in their footsteps. Thank you, Doug. Up next we have James Gracie. James I see you are signed up for resolution 32010. If you want to come off mute and let me know--[Indiscernible] I will Presearch everybody&#39;s time and speak at the end? Thank you. Trayvon fields. I see you are not present. Up next we have Emily Johnson and I think that--and Raish Rachel you are not present. So Emily, good morning. Good morning. Yes, my name is Emily. I&#39;m with 350 Seattle but speaking for myself. I am very lucky to live in northeast Capitol Hill where three big parks are within a half mile of my house. I would like more people to live in this neighborhood which is well served by transit, has good air quality and shade even on hot days. I wanted to turn my 800 square foot house to a multi-family. Changing the name she essential. They have never been single family zones. In my neighborhood many nice old apartment buildings are smacked next to $2 million homes. Those homes and their value don&#39;t seem to suffer. Instead the apartments and condos make the neighborhood more vibrant. The fact we can&#39;t build those apartments and condos now has to change. Changing can name speaks to what matters about neighborhood. It is a neighborhood, mostly resident. Thank you, Emily. If you would like to send any additional comments please do so. I will call through the names that are registered yet not present.
Rachel, Trayvon fields, Deb Barker, Aaron. Any of--you would like to speak, please call in to the line immediately. Otherwise we will close public hearing. Because I made a mistake at the out set of this meeting and did not call on people during public comment who should been call during public comment, we will reopen that. I will call that was our last Speaker present. Thank you to everybody who provided comment today. This amendment will be considered again when we take up the round in September starting with the public hearing of all of the amendments at our meeting on September 8th. There is no objection, I will reopen the remote public comment period for today&#39;s agenda. I will read through this quickly. I ask everyone please be patient. [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] at this timely call on the public comment periods now open. We will begin with the two people we skipped over earlier this morning. Brian Gracie and James Gracie. So Ryan I see you are here. You want to press Star 6 and Unmute yourself? The floor is yours. I&#39;m--seeing you in our Cue. We will move on to James Gracie and come back to you Ryan. James, I see you present. Press Star 6 to Unmute yourself. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you. In regards to propose amendment number 2, with our propose to change to a multifamily--and in the major shortage of housing and we would love to continue with our alignment and partnership with multiple affordable housing offsets to target the--50 and below AMI for the area, especially in the Highland park area where it is a very well diverse neighborhood and would--would align with the Council&#39;s state of vision and goals for the city. The Council can give due process and ideas from what it constitutes and maybe too small to make the docket. I think we could work our way through the current housing crisis with a smaller property as it is. So we just--love to encourage the Council to help us move this Forwad so we can fulfill our--um--what we to the community in being a 35 year resident and give back as much as we can as we have outgrown the site for ourselves. Thank you, James. And one last call for Ryan Gracie. Ryan I see you are in our meeting. If you want to press Star 6 to Unmute. If not we will move on to the second calling. Ryan Gracie Star 6. Third and last call. Press Star 6, Ryan. I do not see you coming off mute. Seeing as we have no additional speakers present the public comment period is now open and we will move on to the next agenda item. Thank you colleagues for your patience. Our next item of business is a briefing and discussion of Council bill 120121. Will you please read the abbreviated title into the record. An ordinance related to land use and zoning adopting interim provisions by amending code--Sdmrrn thank you. We are joined by interim director Rico Quirindongo and Magda Hogness, Mike Podowski and Ketil Freeman do. You have any opening notes before the presentation? None except to note this will be back in front of this Committee on August 11th for a hearing and possible vote. In addition to the presentation there is also a memorandum for me. I&#39;m happy to go through that. Thank you. Take it away. Good morning. Thank you Council member Strauss for the time today. The legislation we are here to talk about today is in direct response to--the terrible impact the pandemic has had on our business community as I think most people are aware we lost over 40 had 0 businesses in the core due to the pandemic and the need for people to stay at home. The opportunity that we are seeking at this time is to open up our land use--well opportunities to create new business opportunities in the core for folks to bring in different types of businesses and uses that previously were not allowed due to the restriction of restaurants and retail in our retail core doors. Um, I will turnover the Mic to Magda in a moment. I want to say as we look to recovery, we are looking to bring people back like revitalize and get people back in downtown and signal reopening. So this temporary legislation is one of many different vehicles for the city to do that. With that I will hand it over to Magda. Thank you, Rico. As Rico mentioned this is one piece of an approach that has many related efforts. It is focused in on the street level ground floor within a specific area of downtown. Filling vacant store fronts and existing buildings is a shared priority in the immediate term survival and a broader economic recovery. The latest numbers that showed the latest figures from June this year showed this need. This area which is focused on the proposed legislation you are seeing today has seen over 340 businesses close over the past year and a half and of that approximately half have already been filled with new businesses and just for a little bit of context, Pre-Pandemic the number of closures was usually consistent--was usually less than number of new openings. Each time Dsa conducted this inventory. So the number of businesses would always continue to grow. What we are looking at here is we know that there is a need for additional help the market will do on its own. And that this legislation is just one piece of supporting downtown recovery and all of the other good projects which we will touch on a little bit later on in this presentation. With that I will pass -- I have one question on this slide before I move on. Data from the downtown Seattle Association also shows 2.5% retail vacancy rate downtown in 2020 compared to a 3 to 4% vacancy rate from 2010 to 2020. Can you or do you know how many of these are permanent closures and new openings and how this compares to a Pre-Pandemic year? Certainly. I think that will--I can explain a little bit and might require some follow up. But what you are seeing here is the number of businesses that have permanently closed over the past year and a half at the ground level versus an end reopening. So Dsa is doing more of fine grain look into this area and how it relates to their vacancy rates overall is something we will need to follow up on. Again the Pre-Pandemic we did reach out to them to kind of understand what the difference is in and would be in a Pre-Pandemic in the past and this number of closures was always less than the number of new openings. I get the sense that that is related to new construction and might be an additional layer of information there. We will be happy to report back. Thank you. Vice chair Mosqueda, please. Thank you very much. Appreciate the clarification ton permanent closures here. One of my questions is do you have similar data looking at other neighborhood hubs across our city, West Seattle, central district, North gate. Are there similar Statistics we can look at? We--so Dsa does Kwlekt data from additional neighborhoods but they are focused in closer to downtown so South Lake Union as well as first Hill, lower queen Ann or uptown or included. I don&#39;t think the data does include information on West Seattle. That is something we can provide more context on. Just another follow up if I may. Um, do we though--does the city have any data points of its own data is they shared with us to have a better indication of store front closures across the city? So the--we have worked with Oab to--get a sense of the--what the changes might be and one point of data we could collect is the business licensing information. As a whole Dsa--as what they have done multiple surveys and that I believe is how they are collecting this fine grain information which is more up to date than business licenses. Okay. Thanks so much. Again, thank you very much for your work. One other thing I would be interested in--is either data on child care closures as well. I think we are interested in seeing how we can support more businesses coming down town and to neighborhood hubs across Seattle. We continue to hear from businesses that one of the things they need is child care for them as small business owners or for their workers as well. If there is anyway to get that data, we are interested as well. Thank you guys, chair. Mike, did you want to--or Magda is passing it to Mike is I think how I interrupted this a moment ago. Mike, feel free to take it away Yes, of course. Next slide, please. Now we will turn to the proposal. It is focused on existing buildings. We are making use of some state rules that allow for expedition adoption of the legislation and then that would also allow it to be in place for a temporary amount of time. We are proposing 12 months. Business would be good to operate. We are focussing on the areas in town where the land use code limits uses as director corn mentioned to basically retail uses, restaurants and entertainment uses. Things that seem to be suffering in particular in this area with the loss of convention Goers, t office workers concentrated in the area as well as the drop off in tourist. So the proposal would apply to a series of map streets that really fill the area between Pike place market and the convention center and extend North and South out of downtown along some of the major path ways to the neighborhoods as well as Pioneer square. We noted in the slide that Chinatown International districts enjoys a situation more flexible that we propose to expend into Pioneer square. There are no changes to Chinatown that are proposed in this bill as they already enjoy the amount of flexibility we are hoping to in part on the remaining areas shown on the map. As we expand the list of uses we are moving away from what most people consider to be the most active uses but we think there is some ways we could allow the expanded list of types of businesses to be located here and still pro--provide the most maximum amount of interest they can. As mentioned in the first point, we are using some special state legislation. We will do our environmental work for the legislation after Council ADOPTS it probably in the late summer or early fall. Next slide, please. . Mike, on that last--sorry, Hi one question. Can you speak to why South Lake Union uptown and first Hill were not included in this legislation? As you can see it is rather extensively mapped downtown. There is a broad area around what we call the retail core as well as in Pioneer square where we limit what can happen at street level. In these other neighborhoods that you mentioned that the mapping is nowhere near as extensive even though the limited uses are similar. In could--this could be a first step. We are trying to focus on the areas mostly affected. Thank you. I see Council member Lewis. I thought your question might be a good opportunity to flag an amendment I am intending to bring for this legislation when we finally continue it for--or have that process on voting on it at the next committee meeting to extend these land use changes to the South Lake Union neighborhood. This is based on extensive stake holder outreach to my office. I was going to flag my amendments later. I think that will be amendment 1 that I&#39;m pursuing. I thought this would be a good opportunity based on your question to flag that. Thank you Council member Lewis. Intide--fantastic. It is drawn largely from the uses that are already allowed in our neighborhood business districts. This broader range of flexibility and the types of businesses and uses that that can be located is already enjoyed in places like Ballard and the West Seattle junction Pashthss of Southeast Seattle as well as the central district and Capitol Hill. We have looked at some uses here that could served range of needs. I will pull out a couple for example at the top left. People talk about pop up businesses. Art installations have also been a good tool for filling vacant store fronts during periods such as this. We are proposing to expand the ability to do that along these Street fronts. Half we down on the left one of the things that is pretty commonly found at street level in the business districts is medical service uses. Doctors, dentists, physical therapists. We think those kind of things can generate some more activity and be a good compliment to the businesses that we like to see downtown. At the bottom on the far right in addition to the expanded list of uses we were also proposing the director would be the don director have the ability to consider uses that we didn&#39;t put on our list but that could spark more activity and interest in these areas. So there is a little bit of a--ad hocking to allow us to consider other creative ideas that might come up. Thank you Chlt. Could you and maybe we should wait till the next committee. It would be helpful to have a crosswalk to see what is already allowed, what is being brought into this legislation, what is left out or maybe you could start by briefly speaking to it now and have a crosswalk for us at the next committee. Absolutely. For people following along at home, there is such a list in the Sdci director&#39;s report. We will pull out that information to highlight it for the next meeting. In this list you will see at the bottom on the left this idea has come up that for certain uses bike facilities for serving office uses or lobbies, gyms and activity areas that serve hotels and residential towers, it might be good to allow those things to occupy some of these empty store fronts. That gets people coming and going and might free up space in the building that could serve another income producing purpose. That is not allowed in the neighborhood business districts right now. That would be unique to hear and something we are trying to under size. On the flip side one of the things allowed in the business districts that we did front pose--didn&#39;t propose to include is office use. In the business districts a lot of what we see on the second and higher floors are housing. So that is the friend that. Those are the two main differences I would say. Thank you. We will pull that out in more detail for the next meeting. Yeah, having a direct crosswalk would be helpful. Vice chair Mosqueda, did I see you had a hand? I was just going to build on your comment Mr. chair about the additional data you would like to see for the other neighborhood business areas. I appreciate the brief answer that there is already some additional allowance for different building types in other neighborhood hubs across the city if I understood your answer correctly. I think it is more about an equity concern. When you do draw the data for the I through I would like to see an analysis about what is being left out as the chair described. It is not just about flexibility. I think it is about the Mha exemptions we are also applying here and how we could be potentially looking at other neighborhood hubs who need similar discretion and Exempts to allow for those smaller business--district hubs to flourish. Thank you vice chair. Feel free to continue on or colleagues if you have any colleagues that have questions, please raise your hand. I think we will Segway back over to Magda and then we will wrap things up. Just a couple of slides left. Council member did I see your hand? No. I was waving at you. Hi. . Ready for the next slide. Great. Thank you so much for the discussion and the questions related to equity. That is definitely a piece of this that we are intentionally taking a look at and with this work we are intent to remove barriers experienced by small businesses as well as offer supporting programs. With this ledge isolation we have been mindful and making sure it supports and does not harm businesses. We have done a few sessions for Intentioning outreach to see what would be helpful for people to hide into Cid and Pioneer square focussing there. And with that we are--as we mentioned earlier this is an approach with many pieces and legislation is an important piece as well as kind of creating opportunities for information gathering and--sharing ways to entice additional businesses as well as provide an openness to helping work through any issues that surface within the--different permitting requirements or different pieces that it takes to produce a business downtown and I know that Oed is working on many programs within the downtown recovery work they are doing and we are--collaborating closely with them as well. With that I will pass it to Mike to explain a little more specifics. In addition to the measures coming, we are look at ways to help people that would be seeking permits to fill these vacant spaces. We. Are evaluate--[Indiscernible] the permit fast Illation would be part of our equity approach here. I think we are wrapping up. We are. Thank you all. Colleagues, any other questions? Council member Lewis I understand you have amendments to share. Would you like to speak to those? Yes. Thank you, Mr. chair. I believe that Daniela on my staff has distributed working drafts for those amendments to the members of the committee and to your staff so I&#39;m happy to just jump into them real quick. One of them which I eluded to earlier was to extend the coverage area of these changes to the South Lake Union neighborhood. South Lake Union neighborhood of course also positioning itself to have a recovery based on a more dynamic use of street level space and a lot of the stake holders in that neighborhood feel like they could take advantage of these unique and innovative opportunities to get more tenants and more unique tenants into store level activated--street level activated uses. So look forward to bringing that amendment forward. The second amendment that I am seeking to bring would add to the list of uses shown earlier in the presentation off the space and like manufacturing. So there has been a lot of interest from stake holders in the downtown Seattle Association, people working in commercial real estate and talking to perspective tenants to activate street level uses to use street level space for additional office space or for some kind of make or space like a light manufacturing use. Given the situation we are in where there has been a considerable amount of businesses over the course of Covid that have shuttered and won&#39;t be coming back, I want to be guided by what our partners in the real estate market are seeing in terms of demand to make innovative use of some of these spaces. Office space and light manufacturing are not currently on the list that has come from the Department. It is something that our partners would like to see. I will be bringing that amendment to Expan slightly to that list of uses we discussed in that slide earlier. Again those uses being street level office space and might manufacturing. On amendment 3 this is a sort of technical amendment allowing administrative approval for street level changes in the Pioneer square special review district. There are unique rules as Mr. chair is well aware in the district in terms of show swiftly we can stand up alternative street level uses. This would simply allow the planning director administrative approval to green light some of these street level changes if buildings within the special review district wanted to incorporate one of these historically Nonconforming street level uses. It is just a necessary change to work some of these temporary changes into the frame work of the special review district. Currently those are the three amendments I&#39;m pursuing. My staff and I are talking to lots of stake holders in these neighborhoods. It is possible that might lead to some additional amendments for consideration and anticipation in the next committee. Currently those are the three I am working on. Happy to talk between this meeting and the next with any committee men Betters who have any questions on these amendments. All of them were generated with considerable stake Holdering from our partners who are working on economic develop Flment these neighborhoods and really Internalizing what this rehearing from perspective tenants and how they can best work to rebuild their neighborhoods in partnership with us here. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to preview those. Drafts have been distributed to all committee offices and happy to answer questions over the next few weeks. Thank you Council member Lewis. Having that preview is helpful. It is my understanding the final versions have not yet been created. Is that a Kreks understanding? Yes, council member Strauss. These are working drafts is probably the best way I would phrase it. I don&#39;t really know if they will materially change all that much in a substantive way based on where they are. They there may be technical Tweaks and whatever in the run up to our next meeting. Thank you. Vice chair. Also--Magda if you would like to stop sharing screen you are more than welcomed to. Thank you very much Mr. chair. I want to thank Council member Lewis as well for the preview of those amendments. I do have some interest in following up on the permitted uses and seeing if there is any additional way that we can--Incentivize and support the creation of more child care fast--facilities as well. We just put $5 million in our Seattle rescue plan to help support the capital--for capital dollars for the creation of additional child care facilities specifically to help our smallest businesses be able to have a draw to economic hubs including downtown so more people have safe places for their Kiddos to have care. As we think about recovering and having a reset button here for us to have a more equitable recovery post Covid, one of the things I would like to don&#39;t do is create more incentives for child care. We hear that there is more Doggy day care in downtown Seattle than there is Kiddo day care. This has been a big priority for us to make sure our Furry friends as well as our babies and Kiddos have the care they need. So I&#39;m very interested in seeing if there is any possibility for us to create additional incentives. Thank you for being creative in many ways here. I still would like to see that data about what barriers may exist in other economic regions, economic hubs in regions of our city to see if this should be more broadly applied. I appreciate the expansion to South Lake Union. I don&#39;t have any objection to that. Also would like to see how we can support folks. Those are the two Areasly be looking into and appreciate the chance for the preview today. Thank you, vice chair. Colleagues, any other questions on this bill at this time? Seeing none--yes? Excuse me. I just want to confirm that we--when we get the response back we can look at those questions through that equity lens given the larger number of large businesses downtown versus the smaller businesses around our city and those smaller businesses that may be women of color led. Just hoping that equity analysis will be possible? Mike or Magda could you share? I would appreciate the--we meet the vice chair&#39;s expectations with this request. We will certainly see what we can do. And work closely with the rest of the central staff to meet that request. Great. Thank you. Colleagues, any other questions at this time? Seeing none I want to thank everyone for being here for this briefing today. The legislation will be back before the Committee on August 11th for public hearing at which point I hope to suspend the rules and vote given the Timeline of these changes unless there is Interveeng data or something comes up in the meantime. We still are on track to pass this with urgency. Thank you. Our next agenda item is a public hearing and possible vote on Council bill 120108 which AMENDS the Yesler terrace plan. Will you please read the abbreviated title into the record? Agenda item 3, council bill 120108 an ordinance relating to the Redevelopment at the Yesler terrace community. Thank you. We are joined for this item by rod Brandon, Terry Gagliardi and Rachelle from Seattle housing authority and Aly Pennucci. Aly, could you provide a brief refresher on the proposal? Good morning chair Strauss, committee members. I am happy to provide a brief over view. So, council bill 120130 is related to the Yesler terrace planned ordinance. At the time the council passed that ordinance 2012 the city had not yet approved the future--[Indiscernible] when they were creating the original tree protection plan. The city finalized the lay out in 2014 and the tree protection plan now needs to be adjusted accordingly. Additionally the city has determined on on site planting of all of the required replacement trees would be difficult to achieve if not impossible due to space constraints. So the bill before you today would update maps to reflect existing conditions and correct errors found by staff at the time of adoption to present. It would correct the tree inventory to be consistent with the trees shown on the map. It updates provisions for development proposals that meet the terrace planned action ordinance requirements within the master plan community. To have the option to use payment in lieu of Preplanting if allowed by code and offset group planting. And clarify reporting on tree removal mitigation is to occur after the development contemplated in the terrace planned action ordinance is completed. So--that ordinance is in effect till 2032. That is the legislation before you today. Thank you, Aly. We are also joined by director rod Brandon, Terry and Rachelle. Would you like to add anything before we open the public comment? And we will have more time to speak to the bill and the amendments after public comment. Real briefly. Thank you very much. Thank you for considering this bill and technical changes as well as the changes to the plan. We really appreciate you looking at alternatives for us. We as you know have a strong commitment to fulfill our obligation. When we can we will make sure we make adjustments. Without that I think she did a great job in doing a briefing. We will be Striebl answer any questions after you hear any public comments as well. Thank you very much. Thank you. Colleagues, any other comments before we open up for public hearing? Seeing none. Before we open the remote public hearing I would ask everyone please be pay Slernt--patient as we continue to learn this new system.

Room. August 11, 2021, the meeting of the land use community will come to order. It is 9AM, I am Dan Strauss. I will alert the committee when more of our colleagues sign in. The land use and neighborhoods committee of the city of Seattle, every committee meeting we start, we begin by acknowledging that we are on the traditional lands of indigenous people here. We are on the traditional land of the first people of this region, past and present. Represented in a number of tribes and as urban natives. In honor with gratitude, the land itself and the people of this land. We start with this acknowledgment to recognize the fact that we are guests on this land and should steward ourselves, steward our work and our land as a community. We are on the traditional land of the first people of this region, past and present. Represented in a number of tribes and as urban natives. We are on the traditional land of the first people of this region, past and present. Should steward ourselves, steward of our work and our land as such, as guests. This is not intended to be a checklist. This doesn&#39;t give us a passport to proceed however we desire. This is a reminder volume of every meeting we need to steward our work as guests as our time here is short. We will be starting at 930 a.m. with a brief briefing. We will begin by holding a possible vote on council bill 120121 which adopts interim regulations for downtown storefronts. And a briefing on council bill 120153 which updates standards for small lots in belltown. Our next meeting of the land use and neighborhoods committee will be Wednesday, September 8th starting at 930 a.m. before we begin if there&#39;s no objection, the agenda will be adopted. Hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted. I ask that everyone please be patient as we learn to operate this new system in real time. While it remains the strong intent to have public comment regularly included on meeting agendas, the city council reserves the right to end or eliminate the public comment period at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or is unsuitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner in which we are able to conduct our necessary business. I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner. The public comment period for this meeting is up to ten minutes. Each speaker will be given two minutes to speak. I will call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the council&#39;s website. If you have not yet registered to speak and would like to, you can sign up before the end of public comment by going to the council&#39;s website. The public comment link is also listed on today&#39;s agenda. Once I call the speaker&#39;s name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt if you have been unmuted will be the speaker&#39;s cue that it is their turn to speak. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item in which you are addressing. Speakers will hear a chime when ten seconds are remaining of the allotted time. Once you have completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line and if you plan to continue following this meeting, please do so via Seattle channel or the listening options listed on today&#39;s agenda. There is a separate public hearing for item one, council bill 120121, which is the recommendation of the council to approve the public comment period for this meeting. I will call the speaker&#39;s name and in the order in which they registered on the council&#39;s website. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item in which you are addressing. I will call the speaker&#39;s name and in the order in which they registered on the council&#39;s website. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item in which they registered on the council&#39;s website, please. Council member, please proceed to public comment period, 120121, which adopts interim regulations for downtown storefronts. If you wish to speak about this item, please sign up for the appropriate public hearing. The public comment period is now open. We have one speaker signed up today. Council bill. Let me just confirm that. Great. So public comment is now open. We have one public commenter, megan cruz. Good morning, megan. You&#39;ve got two minutes. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. I&#39;m commenting. This is megan cruz and I&#39;m commenting today on cb120153, the bill to establish alternative development standards for small lots in the downtown mixed residential zones. And you might predict what I have to say, but I hope you&#39;ll consider it. As it currently stands, this bill creates environmental and human health consequences that needs to still be thoroughly vetted and studied for conditional uses. That issue is the loss of light to adjacent buildings and neighborhood streets. Current building code provides for graduated upper level setbacks, exactly because they provide these things, things people need for their physical and mental health. In traditional construction zones just a few blocks away, they have no problem blocking 75 to 99% of light to neighbors in adjacent buildings. I live in a building next to such a proposal where half the people in our building and one third in another residential building will be severely impacted. And then there&#39;s the environmental impacts. Sdci reports downtown residential construction is now at 95% of the capacity projected in the last five years. We have seen the evidence. The heat map the city recently helped produce shows downtown is in an extreme danger heat zone, equivalent only to the county&#39;s industrial areas. And this is due to its dense development and lack of tree coverage. By allowing every small downtown lot to now achieve maximum density of 145 to even 280 feet, it will not produce as much heat as it did in the last five years. It will not produce as much electricity as it did in the last five years. It will not produce a livable resilient downtown. It will do the opposite. Currently this plan trades monetary gain without protections for human and environmental health or might I add providing affordable housing. Please send this bill back to make sure it does all these things. Thank you. Thank you, may. Clerk, can you confirm or i.t. There are no more public comment registrants. There are no more public comment registrants. Thank you. There are no more public comment registrants. Seeing as we have no additional speakers present, we will move on to the next agenda item. Our first item of business today is a public hearing discussion and possible vote on council bill 120121, which adopts interim regulations for the downtown storefronts. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the agenda? Your follow-up on the motion and action. Agenda item one, council bill 120121, an ordinance relating to land use and zoning adopting interim provisions to facilitate occupancy of street level spaces downtown during the COVID-19 civil emergency. Thank you. We are joined by presenters from our central staff as well as city departments to answer questions that councilmembers may have. We will start with council members from the city of Washington, and then we will have CCCI and OPCD have some slides responding to councilmembers&#39; questions from the last meeting. Sure. Thank you, chair Strauss. Council central staff, I&#39;ll just briefly remind the committee what council bill 120121 would do and then preview four potential amendments. So as the committee will recall, council bill 120121 would modify downtown street level uses. It would create a street level use standard that calls for street level uses to generate pedestrian interest, encourage pedestrian activity and strengthen connection between functional areas of downtown. How is that implemented? That&#39;s implemented among other ways through street level use development standards that prescribe activating street level uses. So CB120121 would expand the list of uses that are authorized as street level uses and would create a street level use standard. There would be an authority in the growth management act, RCW3670A390 that allows local governments to put in place so-called interim development controls. These are interim development controls. Proposed additional uses would include food processing and craft work, accessory spaces like lobbies and intermediary areas to downtown residential towers and lodging uses and parking lots. The bill would also authorize the SDCI director to permit through a type 1 decision, an administrative decision, so a decision not subject to public comment, notice or appeal, any kind of use that meets a couple of criteria, increases pedestrian activity and also increases the range of goods and services downtown. It would reserve to the DON director and the pioneer square preservation board the authority to make decisions about uses in downtown. It would also allow uses established through the bill to be maintained as existing nonconforming uses as long as that use is around. So that makes, you know, obviously, entities that want to take advantage of the revised development standards would need to enter into leases and so it makes sense to not have those uses expire when the regulations expire. It would exempt owners of buildings who have participated in bonus programs like the city mandatory housing affordability program or other regulatory programs that preceded MHA. It would exempt them from additional payments under those bonus programs and finally it would establish a work program for consideration of permanent changes which is a requirement of authorizing legislation under 3670A390, so as an interim control. There are four amendments proposed by committee members, one by the chair and three by councilmember lewis. Councilmember strauss&#39; proposed amendment is largely a housekeeping amendment. It would modify the findings to reflect the current state of pandemic restrictions and coronavirus spread and also modify a section that presumed that the council would hold a public hearing after action on the ordinance. Councilmember lewis has three substantive amendments. He has an amendment that would expand the area where the interim controls apply to the public. It would also make some corresponding changes to the findings to support that change. Councilmember lewis&#39; second amendment would add office with limited frontage and light manufacturing as uses that would qualify as interim street level uses. The amendment would also remove a proposed limitation on street frontage for accessory uses like lobby space. And there&#39;s a definition of light manufacturing that I can go into when the committee takes up this proposed amendment. It&#39;s not a new definition. It&#39;s what&#39;s currently in the code. Finally, councilmember lewis&#39; third amendment would authorize the don director to make administrative decisions about authorizing and conditioning uses at the street level. So those are the potential uses. I think opcd and sdci have a presentation that responds to some questions. I&#39;m going to turn it over to councilmember lewis. I think he has a presentation that responds to some questions and requests for information from the last committee meeting. Thank you, Mr. freeman. I see magda with us and director karendongo with us. And mike. Good morning, mike. Who should I pass it to? Mr. podowski? Magda? I&#39;m going to pass it to magda who has a presentation to share with us. We&#39;ve had a couple of really good productive work sessions and conversations in consideration of the amendments that were just put on the table. So we&#39;ll the presentation deck is to address kind of those issues and considerations and then I want to answer any questions that folks have. Magda, you should go ahead and get started. Thank you. Thank you, rico. So as rico mentioned, a lot of this information we&#39;ve put together in response to the that was requested last time. Just as a brief reminder of the kind of pertinent changes that we are hoping to pursue. And a reminder from last time that this is really just one approach to a need, a shared need in really filling these currently vacant storefronts downtown. And so with this co-change, it&#39;s one approach. It would be temporary for 12 months and then remain in perpetuity. And this is a slightly different and this is a slide that we showed last time which is based on the area that we were originally proposing. This next slide is a comparison showing the area including south lake union. And so just wanted to offer a bit of information in terms of context. Within south lake union, the uses where the land use code restricts the uses is much more limited. And also there&#39;s a lot of information. And also there was a community process, the urban design framework that really laid out in looking where to require street-level uses and what types of uses should be located. So those are predominantly located along the half blocks facing west lake as well as valley. And also one point of information, the latest data from dsa shows that the more than 1,000 units within south lake union are bouncing back which is good to see. Another consideration that came up being proposed is the office at street use, at street level. And so I want to just pull some additional information to share in that there is currently a vacancy and there&#39;s expected to remain above 10% with office use downtown until 2024. And as mike explained last time, you know, one of the key differences between some of these uses and where we&#39;re drawing them from which is the neighborhood business districts and the uses downtown, there is a difference in context. So as we all know, downtown and south lake union, there&#39;s a variety of office spaces. And so that&#39;s why we originally did not include that within the proposal. With that, I will hand it over to mike to explain a little bit more about the uses and to do a walk through some of the information that we have. So we showed this slide last time. It&#39;s the proposed supplemental uses that as magda mentioned are drawn largely from the neighborhood business districts. Let&#39;s look at the next slide, please. At the last meeting, council member Strauss asked us to prepare a crosswalk that compares the different use allowances. So on the left-hand side of this table is the column of downtown uses that are currently allowed. And as kito pointed out, are exempt from floor area limits and various incentive zoning programs. In the middle is the more general use of things that are allowed at street level in the neighborhood business districts. Highlighted in yellow are some of the uses that we borrowed from this list to propose to use to expand what&#39;s allowed downtown. And then on the far right is a list of the uses that we borrowed from this list. Highlighted in yellow is code and from folks. Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Okay. I&#39;ll continue. Should I continue? Are we good? Okay. Yeah. I apologize. Sorry about that. Yeah. I&#39;m sorry. It was council member Juarez here. My internet is going on, so you can&#39;t hear me. It&#39;s my internet. I apologize. There was some sort of zoom interruption there. Sorry about that. Oh, okay. There was. It looks like crash for all of us. It happened for me as well. Okay. Good. I&#39;m not the only knucklehead. Great. We&#39;re in the same boat today. It&#39;s not a kayak. Should I rewind a little bit? Yeah. I missed. You might want to go back about two minutes or so. The bottom left-hand side is what&#39;s currently allowed downtown at street level. As Ketel mentioned, these are exempt from floor area limits and the various incentive zoning programs. The middle column are the list of uses allowed in the business districts. The ones highlighted in yellow are the ones we&#39;ve borrowed to expand the downtown list. And then on the right is the cumulative list of what we&#39;re proposing to add to downtown as well as some additional ones that were suggested by the downtown Seattle association and other constituents downtown as well as borrowed from some other parts of the code. So the proposal is composed of the yellow in the middle and the green. And that would expand the list of uses that are allowed at street level downtown, and we&#39;re proposing that we treat the entire list the same, the existing plus the supplemental uses with respect to how that floor area exemption applies so that, you know, you can pick and choose amongst the broader range of lists as a method to help fill the vacancies that can&#39;t be filled with the more restricted set of uses that&#39;s allowed downtown. And I should point out that, you know, the way that exemption applies, it&#39;s just where the street level uses are required. So it&#39;s 75% of the buildings that face the streets that are mapped on that map that Magda showed earlier. So really the exemption and the ability to not make an MHA payment, for example, is limited to that space within a building. And then within that space currently you can pick and choose from any of the menu items here on the left-hand column and not have to make any sort of payment and be exempt from the floor area limits. All we&#39;re proposing to do is to expand that list so within that within those buildings you have more to choose from and thereby hopefully fewer vacancies and more opportunities for active uses and drawing people to, you know, downtown and more lively sidewalks. I&#39;ll stop there to see if there are any questions. Thanks, Mike. I do have a number of questions, although I think that it&#39;s more of just the clarity of this table. The one thing that jumps out to me is horticulture uses. I know in Ballard when we had horticulture uses, horticultural uses, agricultural uses in Ballard, we had to pass the Ballard cow law. So when cows wandered south of 65th, those farmers would get fined. Can you help me understand what&#39;s going on with horticultural uses in downtown? Well, horticultural uses are similar to, like, you know, agricultural uses. So if you&#39;re a farmer and you have a cow, like, it&#39;s a nursery would be the most common form that that would take. And the thought here was that we allow that in another provision in the code that&#39;s intended to help fill vacant and underused sites, sometimes construction projects when the economy is not good, which has been a while, but, you know, it can happen so that you end up with a vacant site. And horticultural uses was thought to be something that would be kind of interesting and interesting. If the flower stalls that sell fresh-cut flowers at the Pike Place market and then also dried flowers during the wintertime, they might be able to avail themselves of a space in one of these vacancies and actually grow the plants themselves there and then take them over to the market for sale or to do it right here. So I think a nursery is the most common outcome here. Maybe not likely to be the most commonly used, but, again, we have another program that has had some success in the past. Mike, I froze there. Are we all back? I&#39;m not experiencing the freeze, but you probably missed everything I said. No, I caught it all. Oh, you did. Okay. Yeah, with the flowers, growing them. Yes. Yep. Copy. I don&#39;t have any further questions at this time. Okay. Yeah. Colleagues? Seeing none. Do we have more comments from departments on this bill? All right. You&#39;ve got more slides. Please take it away. One thing to point out on this slide was that, you know, beyond the land-use legislation, which would provide more flexibility for filling the vacancies, there are some programmatic things that are being discussed. There&#39;s been a lot of collaboration with the office of economic development and the federal monies that are available to help people in the recovery as well as, you know, others in the various neighborhoods that are affected. Wanted to just highlight the permit support at SDCI. We are looking at expediting permits starting with downtown but also expanding out into the neighborhood business districts and providing for a permit facilitator who can help understand emergent needs, you know, conduct some survey work, prepare language materials, and be ready to facilitate small businesses getting into the spaces and getting the permits that they need from SDCI as well as others like the public health agency. So there&#39;s an expansive effort here that includes more than just the land-use code changes that are proposed. Thank you. Thank you, Mike. That&#39;s what we wanted to cover and happy to answer questions. Anything else to add? Colleagues, any questions? I have a question, Mr. Chair. Please. And I apologize. I was trying to print all this out but I gave up. Just quickly, it&#39;s an interim provision for amending, correct, to expand the uses for the permit? Correct. And it&#39;s an interim provision to expand the uses for downtown and you mentioned business and going to other neighborhoods. Do you have to be an official BIA to take advantage of the expansion of filling in storefront spaces? Because, you know, we have those kind of spaces along Aurora lake city way and north gate. Sure. Can you go back to the crosswalk? I was looking at that. I just texted my staff to make sure I was on page six. Yeah. So the list in downtown is much more limited than the list that&#39;s allowed in the neighborhood business districts outside of downtown and that would be one of the things that we&#39;d like to cure with this legislation. The business districts already enjoy the much broader list and we don&#39;t expect that the land use code is the impediment there. It&#39;s probably other non-land use code things. Right. But it isn&#39;t an official business. It&#39;s just a business district, kind of BIA. Yeah. This list applies where the zoning is neighborhood commercial with a pedestrian designation. Sorry. Okay. So it&#39;s zoning driven. Thank you so much. You&#39;re welcome. Excellent question, Councilmember Juarez. Okay. Colleagues, other questions? We will have more discussion after the public hearing. Seeing no further questions at this time, we will move into the public hearing. Before we open the remote public hearing, I would again ask that everyone please be patient. As we continue to learn and operate the system in real time and navigate through the inevitable growing pains, we are continuously looking for ways to fine tune this process and adding features that allow for additional means of public participation in our council meetings. I will moderate the public hearing in the following manner. Each speaker will be given two minutes to speak. I will call on one speaker at a time and in the order in which they registered on the council&#39;s website, if you have not yet registered to speak and would like to, you can sign up before the end of the public hearing by going to the council&#39;s website at Seattle.gov forward slash council. The link is also on today&#39;s agenda. Once I call on the speaker&#39;s name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt if you have been unmuted will be the speaker&#39;s cue that it is their turn to speak. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item in which you&#39;re addressing. As a reminder, the public comment should relate to the comprehensive plan docketing excuse me, for let me get the should be in relation to council bill 120121 which adopts interim regulations for the downtown storefronts. Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of the allotted time. Once you hear the chime, we ask you please begin wrapping up your public comments. If speakers do not end their public comments at the end of the allotted time provided, speaker&#39;s microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next speaker. Once you have completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line and if you do not wish to speak at the end of the allotted time provided, please disconnect from the line and if you plan to continue following this meeting, please do so via the Seattle channel or the listening options listed on today&#39;s agenda. The public hearing on council bill 120121 is now open and we will begin with the first speaker on the list. Confirming with sun, there are no public hearing registrants currently present. Is that correct? I&#39;m sorry. There are no public hearing registrants. Thank you. Being that there is not a member of the public remotely present for the public hearing on council bill 120121, public hearing is now closed. So council members, given this is where we now have to make a decision, at the last meeting regarding this bill, we had asked for a fair amount of information, vice chair Mosqueda, to provide specific data. I want to check to see colleagues, your comfort level, because we are having a public hearing on the same day as voting on a bill possibly, we would need to suspend the rules. Colleagues, if you do not feel comfortable having received the appropriate data that you feel is necessary to move forward with this bill, we can vote on the amendments today and hold the next committee meeting, or I would just like to take this moment to gauge people&#39;s interest, or we can make that decision at the end of this bill. Council member Lewis, I see you have your hand raised. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would have no objection to suspending the rules and voting on final passage of the bill today, but respect the decision of the chair either way in terms of how you want to approach this. Okay. And I know council member Lewis, you have some outstanding questions on one of your amendments that I would love to talk to you about. Vice chair Mosqueda, I know that you had questions. Do you feel that they have been answered at this time? Or, yes, I&#39;m seeing thumbs up. Wonderful. Well, then, given ---- I don&#39;t know. I may have some issues. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m feeling it, thinking about it. If council member Mosqueda is in, I&#39;m in, too. I think we just do it, get it done. Great. So I&#39;d like to ask, let&#39;s see. So in that case, I would move to suspend the rules and allow us to vote on the same day as a public hearing. Is there a second? Second. It has been moved and seconded to suspend the rules to allow a vote on the same day as a public hearing. Will the clerk please call the roll? Council member Peterson? Yes. Council member Lewis? Yes. Council member Juarez? Yes. Council member Mosqueda? Aye. And chair Strauss? Yes. Five in favor and none opposed. Thanks. It&#39;s been moved and seconded to suspend the rules to allow a vote on the same day as a public hearing, and the motion carries. Let&#39;s walk through the amendments first. I am proposing the first amendment, which makes technical corrections and reflects the current state of the pandemic. Mr. Freeman, is there anything that you&#39;d like to add to the amendment? I think it&#39;s a good one. I think it&#39;s a good one. I think it&#39;s a good one. I think it&#39;s a good one. I think it&#39;s a good one. I think it&#39;s a good one. I think it&#39;s a good one. Mr. Freeman, is there anything you&#39;d like to add? I appreciated your overview at the head of the meeting. I know. Would you like me to share these amendments as we go through? Yes, please. You sent around that great summary table. For the benefit of those folks who may be watching, I can put them up on the screen. This is a summary of the proposed bill. There are a number of things to reflect the current state of affairs with respect to the pandemic and how long it&#39;s been going on. The bill as introduced also assumed that the council would hold a public hearing after full council action, which was an option under RQW 3678-390. Obviously the hearing was held today. So this just conforms the current state of affairs. Great. Thank you. Colleagues, do you have any questions on amendment one? Hearing no questions, I move to amend council bill 120121 as shown in the Strauss amendment one. Is there a second? Second. Moved and seconded to amend council bill 120121 as shown in Strauss amendment one. All in favor? Aye. Motion carries. Council member Peterson? Yes. Council member Lewis? Yes. Council member Juarez? Yes. Council member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Strauss? Yes. All in favor? None opposed. Motion carries. Council member Lewis, we can now move on to your first amendment, Lewis amendment number two. Would you like Mr. Freeman? I&#39;ll go ahead and let maybe Keetle queue it up first and I&#39;m happy to make a comment after that and formally move the amendment. Sounds great. Sure. So this is council member Lewis&#39;s amendment number one is the amendment that would expand the area where the interim controls would apply to the Seattle mixed South Lake Union zone. It makes an exception for Valley Street across from Lake Union Park. And it also makes some corresponding changes to the findings to reflect information from the South Lake Union chamber.
And Mr. Freeman, this is not the amendment that takes up office space. Is that correct? That&#39;s the next amendment? That&#39;s correct. Great. Council member Lewis, anything to add here? Colleagues, any questions after council member Lewis? Yeah. Thank you, chair Strauss and thanks, Keetle, for queuing that up. One thing I do want to put a fine point on here is, you know, while it&#39;s true that the South Lake Union neighborhood has potentially not felt the brunt of the COVID pandemic as much as some of the other core neighborhoods in the center of the city and downtown, it certainly is the case that the ecosystem, the economic ecosystem in South Lake Union has been very much disrupted by extensive stay at home or stay-at-home working patterns for large South Lake Union business tenants. You know, Amazon, of course, looms larger than ever. Having a really big influx of employees with disposable income in the neighborhood on a daily basis to go to lunch, to patronize other businesses in the neighborhood. So while it is not a neighborhood that is in quite as dire straits as storefronts in downtown, there is interest from the South Lake Union chamber and the downtown Seattle association and other stakeholders in putting some flexibility into this neighborhood to have some of these innovative opportunities to put different uses into some of these storefronts. Certainly this looms larger than ever with delayed return to work schedules from a lot of large employers in South Lake Union. Of course, Amazon recently announced they&#39;re delaying their return to work until 2022, meaning that we could see throughout the fall expanded street-level vacancy and continued hardship for businesses in this area and an interest in attracting new and dynamic tendencies that can withstand this extended period of touch and go return to work and, of course, the surging of a delta variant. I do want to highlight one important carve-out that my office put into this amendment after consultation with the department, and that was to carve out some of this more flexible office or street-level use on Valley Street, which is going to be the frontage that faces the park. You know, there is a very strong public interest in making sure that that use is going to be a dynamic use that is facing the park that is really important to engaging with that open space and that is really providing a lot of spillover out into the sidewalk and activating those streets. So making sure that we aren&#39;t putting, you know, a use like a maker space or light industrial or something in that frontage facing out towards the park is an important policy concern, so that is why Valley is carved out of this proposal to make sure that we have a more flexible use. We have a dynamic use in that storefront instead of something that is more static. But beyond that, it is certainly taking the other considerations for the flexibility in the downtown neighborhood and expanding them to this corridor, so I would just emphasize that this is an amendment that was strongly requested by stakeholders in the South Lake Union neighborhood, including property owners, the chamber of commerce, community members, so it is something that has been requested by the neighborhood and something that we should adopt today. So with that, I don&#39;t have anything else to add, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. I appreciate the background and explanation. This is an amendment that I will be supporting this amendment. Colleagues, any other questions? Otherwise I&#39;ll bring it to a vote. I have a quick point. And this is why I asked the question during the presentation because of these amendments. You don&#39;t have to be specifically carved out in this legislation to enjoy the expansion, the interim expansion of uses for empty storefront. That&#39;s why I asked if, you know, if it&#39;s all controlled, if your area is already zoned for business, then you would be able to enjoy the benefits of this expansion for storefronts for other uses, right? No one is barred if they&#39;re not in this legislation. I don&#39;t have to do an amendment and say put in Lake City Way, put in Northgate, put in Aurora. I&#39;m guessing, I understand Councilmember Lewis, his constituency, and I get it, and downtown. I understand. So I just want to make sure I&#39;m confirming that I don&#39;t have to have 12 amendments for 12 neighborhoods that have businesses that are zoned for business to enjoy this, correct? I believe that&#39;s correct, Mr. Freeman. Can you correct me if I&#39;m wrong with this next statement, which is that it&#39;s my understanding that downtown and Southlake Union have more restrictive street-level uses than other business districts, and so Lake City should be fine, Ballard is going to be fine, your district is fine. Yeah, I just didn&#39;t want people to, because I&#39;m getting some texts saying, well, why aren&#39;t, you know, and so I understand if they&#39;re more restrictive downtown and Southlake Union because of zoning, I understand why you would have the need for that. I just don&#39;t want the viewing public to say, well, if we&#39;re not in there, that means that we can&#39;t use our storefronts and take advantage of this great legislation. So I just wanted that clarification. And, Mr. Chair, I got a couple of texts from people saying that the amendments were not on Legistar. So why they&#39;re texting me, I don&#39;t know. And not you. I&#39;m not the clerk. But they&#39;re saying that these amendments are not on Legistar. So I just thought I&#39;d share that with you. Thank you. Thank you. Can, I&#39;m pulling up Legistar right now to check myself. Happy to share the info. I am hearing now that they were not circulated in time to be published. And so we will, they were sent to council members yesterday, and we will make sure to update Legistar with the appropriate information. Thank you. And they will also be added to the agenda for after this meeting. Thank you. Thank you. So they can be added to the agenda for after this meeting. It&#39;s also helpful why Mr. Freeman is showing them on the screen. So council member, I see Vice Chair Mosqueda, and then I&#39;ll go with you, Council Member Lewis. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. And I want to thank Council Member Juarez for raising that point as well. I also didn&#39;t ask a question during the presentation because during the time between your last meeting and this meeting I had a similar question, if you don&#39;t see something like childcare, so for example, we&#39;re talking about various neighborhoods here, but I was also worried that if we didn&#39;t explicitly call out childcare as being a permissible use and somehow we were missing an opportunity there. But similarly, I just want to confirm that we are making additive adjustments here. The baseline, what was allowable, will continue. So if you don&#39;t see something like childcare, it&#39;s because it&#39;s already a permissible use and that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t bring forward an amendment. I just wanted folks to know that as well. This is not an all-inclusive of only what you can do. These are additive pieces and as Council Member Juarez was saying, can be done across the city, but we want to make sure that downtown, these areas that had more and now South Lake Union, these areas that had more restricted uses can take advantage of this legislation and have some additional flexibility, but childcare was already one of the allowable uses downtown and across our city. Is that correct? That&#39;s correct. Childcare is an allowable use downtown and in South Lake Union. Outside of downtown and South Lake Union, so in pedestrian zones and neighborhood areas, it&#39;s not actually an authorized street level use. So that&#39;s something that could be the subject of further consideration by the Council perhaps with the upcoming land use code omnibus bill if the Council wants to make that policy change. I&#39;m sorry. Can I just check on that something then? So I was not allowed to do that amendment because the title here didn&#39;t permit it. Is that why this? That&#39;s right. So the title here does not cover 2347, which is sort of the commercial chapter that includes childcare. You know, there is a ‑‑ I can sort of tell you anecdotally what I understand from conversations with my colleagues who have worked in depth in street level use issues. I&#39;m thinking of Allie here. At least outside of downtown, childcare was not included in part because not to restrict sort of where those uses could be located, but because it&#39;s often difficult for childcare providers to meet the transparency standards with a level of comfort that they need to for their clients. So I&#39;ll give you a couple of examples just to see if it helps. In the Chinook building there&#39;s childcare at the street level. The Chinook building is the King County administration building. A lot of the windows there are blocked to keep people from looking in at the kids because that&#39;s what the parents of those children expect. So there are some ways in which childcare is not necessarily a great street level use. It&#39;s not to say it&#39;s impossible. Obviously there are places around town where there are childcare at the street level, but that was a consideration in excluding childcare from street level uses in the update to commercial code from a few years ago. Councilmember Mosqueda, does that answer your questions for the time being? I&#39;m seeing head nods. Yes, thank you. I may have some more work to do on this with you, Councilmember Strauss. Happy to partner with you. In the future on other legislation. Let&#39;s do it. I love it. Councilmember Lewis, do you have another comment or would you like to wrap this up, final comments before we move on? Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair. We can wrap it up. The thing I initially raised my hand for was just to make some clarifications about the special status of downtown and South Lake Union that necessitate these changes and differentiate it from neighborhood business districts, and I think that has been well covered by yourself and central staff. So I&#39;m ready just to vote on this. Thank you. So if there&#39;s no other questions or comments, we&#39;ll move on to amendment two. So if I move to amend council bill 120121 as shown in a Lewis amendment. Is it Lewis amendment two or Lewis amendment one? Amendment two. This is Lewis amendment one that we&#39;re on here. So amendment two, Lewis amendment one. So I move to amend council bill 120121 as shown in amendment one. Lewis amendment two as shown in Lewis amendment one. Second. It has been moved and seconded to amend council bill 120121 as shown in Lewis amendment one. Will the clerk please call the roll. Council member Peterson. Yes. Council member Lewis. Yes. Council member Juarez. Yes. Council member Mosqueda. Aye. Chair Strauss. Yes. Five in favor, none opposed. Thank you. The motion carries. Council member Lewis, we can now move on to amendment two. I will just share at the outset that I do have a slight concern about this amendment specifically about office space. I know that my office reached out to your office. They only responded they were only able to respond during the committee so I have not had time to fully digest that information. So I&#39;ll just start with that. That is the very narrow section which I still have questions. So I&#39;ll just start with that. And then we&#39;ll move on to amendment three. So Mr. Freeman, council member Lewis, would you like to take it away? I&#39;ll jump in first just to give an overview and maybe I can kind of make my arguments pitching for this once it&#39;s been moved in front of us. I&#39;ll just make all my remarks now actually. So this amendment would expand some of the new uses for street and office space in the downtown and south lake union neighborhoods. Again for south lake union with the carve out of valley which would not benefit from these expansions. So, you know, I understand some of the concerns that have been expressed by the department regarding the lack of dynamism particularly from the office space use as something that&#39;s allowed at street level. This is something that&#39;s come from talking to a lot of stakeholders in the downtown core about the fact that they are seeing market demand for in some cases having office space as a street level use. I understand that the public policy advantages are more limited versus more dynamic street level uses that will help to activate the neighborhood more than office space which is a fairly static use. I do think that there are advantages if a given street level space is going to be office space or nothing. Certainly if office space is competing with other more dynamic uses I would hope that more dynamic uses would be given the opportunity to be a tenant in that space and to use it. But if there are circumstances like I think particularly about the block on 3rd Avenue where there&#39;s the old crests IGA and TJ Maxx it would certainly be more desirable to have office space as an activation in a location like that than to have nothing activating that space and for it to remain vacant because a different tenant can&#39;t be attracted. So ultimately I came down on putting this amendment forward to give the option to some of our building owners in the downtown core who might have trouble attracting a more dynamic tenant and then places remain vacant for a long, long period of time and it&#39;s of course in all of our interest to make sure that we are utilizing all of the space in our downtown core to the highest degree and having as low a rate of vacancy as possible. So for that I do think that both of these options expanding and allowing both of these options in addition to some of the other things that we&#39;re discussing would be desirable. Just to touch briefly on the light manufacturing component, one of the existing uses that is being permitted in the base legislation is like craft work essentially. So it would be like manufacturing that occurs predominantly by hand. This would expand to include light industrial which, you know, allows some degree of machine assisted process but to the point where it obviously isn&#39;t as, you know, noisy or disruptive or dirty as heavy industrial would be. So it basically allows and, you know, Ketel maybe could queue up some better examples but it would allow for sort of, you know, like maybe like maker spaces or like 3D printing kind of things that are machine assisted but that aren&#39;t, you know, manufacturing entirely by hand like maybe like a leather goods, you know, place. So with that I think I&#39;ll turn it over to Ketel to maybe provide a little bit more technical feedback on this and then open it up for more discussion. Thank you, Councilmember. Mr. Freeman. Sure. I guess there are a few things that I may add here. You know, another thing that this amendment would do is it would also remove a limitation on accessory uses, uses accessory to lodging and residential uses, a street frontage limitation. So just want to make sure that the committee is aware of that proposed change. With respect to the other amendment, with respect to the office use proposed here with a street frontage limitation, a 30-foot street frontage limitation, this is a development standard that is true for as present in pedestrian zones outside of downtown. So it is an authorized street level use outside of downtown. As has been mentioned, downtown is more restrictive outside of downtown and pedestrian designated zones and commercial areas. So it&#39;s not an authorized street level use with this 30-foot street level frontage limitation. With respect to light manufacturing, what it is, light manufacturing is an allowed use in most downtown zones already. It&#39;s just not an allowed street level use. There&#39;s a sort of a brief amendment sheet has a brief definition and there are examples in the code which I&#39;ll go to here in just a minute. But a light manufacturing use is a manufacturing use typically associated with environmental impacts or pollution. Examples given in the code include things such as production assembly finishing and or packaging of articles from parts made at other locations. So we&#39;re finishing a product that is made of component parts that are manufactured elsewhere and the examples given in the code are things like assembly of clocks, electrical appliances and medical equipment. The production of finished household and office goods, so jewelry manufacturing, clothing manufacturing. There&#39;s another light manufacturing use. So those are the types of uses that are light manufacturing called out in the code. Thank you, Mr. Freeman. Councilmember Lewis, I&#39;ll signal to you. I think this is a smart amendment with the light manufacturing. I&#39;m fully supportive of that. I think that&#39;s a good idea. I&#39;m still at this point agnostic on office space because I&#39;ve not had the time to digest the information. I might ask you just here on the real time, would you be open to holding this amendment for a full council to digest that office space a little bit more? Yeah. I think that, Mr. Chair, if you want to spend a little bit more time grappling with this, I&#39;m happy to hold this amendment for further along in the process just so we could maybe go over some of this and make some of the members of the committee a little more comfortable with it. That sounds fine. Yeah. I think your example of IGA crest is a good one. I just want to make sure that as you said as well, we have the most vibrant uses at the street level as possible, and I think that your light manufacturing is a really smart move. Colleagues, do you all have questions on the amendment right now? I&#39;ll just weigh in that I agree with you, Mr. Chair. I needed a little bit more time on the offices provided that no matter what I&#39;m still kind of trying to figure that part out, but I don&#39;t have a problem with the light manufacturing, but I think it would be a good idea just to before we can get some more information to walk it out to full council Monday. That&#39;s great. Seeing ahead, Councilmember Peterson. Thank you, Chair Strauss. I will want to support Councilmember Lewis as a district council member. I appreciate the outreach that he&#39;s done. Thank you. Thanks, Councilmember Peterson. Vice Chair Mosqueda, please. Thank you so much. So if this is going to be discussed again on full council, I think some of the things that I&#39;d love to hear more about are how this sort of conforms with the intent of the legislation as I see it that would be trying to encourage more people to be interacting at these store fronts, to have a more pedestrian feel, to have a lot of activity on our streets. I do worry about store fronts that may be, you know, fully covered if it&#39;s manufacturing or just business offices that they usually do cover up those windows. So those are some of the questions that I&#39;d be looking into, Councilmember Lewis. Great. Councilmember Lewis, take it away. Yeah. You know, I think Councilmember Mosqueda&#39;s questions are good for queuing up a discussion at full council on this, particularly on the office space. I mean, as I sort of went over a little bit in my initial remarks, I think that there are frankly from talking to downtown stakeholders two things at play. I mean, certainly one of them is we want to create a more dynamic environment where there&#39;s a lot of interaction with street level use. But I think that there is, as I touched on, a secondary policy issue here that I think hasn&#39;t been addressed quite as forthrightly in the four corners of the legislation. And frankly, I don&#39;t know that this legislation is necessarily designed to confront this as one of the primary purposes, but maybe as more of a tertiary purpose. But as I alluded to earlier, there are some buildings that we just want to activate, period, in some respect, regardless of if the street level use is going to be dynamic or not. Right? I mean, there&#39;s buildings in the downtown corridor where longstanding vacancies and no use of any type, even a static use, is sort of resulting in, you know, buildings becoming eyesores, buildings becoming targets of graffiti. And the result of that from them not being activated is there is sort of a deteriorating effect to the broader block. So in a case like that, even though office space isn&#39;t that dynamic use, it is still more desirable than nothing being at that location. So Figuring out a way to structure a policy, and this might be maybe key to consult on this before full council, but figuring out some way in some circumstances that office space can come in as kind of a last resort if no other use can be secured is sort of what my intention is, and I know that this is more permissive than that. This is sort of like letting the market decide, and maybe that would result in an unintended consequence, and I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re grappling with. To pivot to the light manufacturing, though, Councilmember Muscata, I do think light manufacturing in some innovative cases could have the potential to be an interesting street-level activation. I mean, I think of things like, you know, Councilmember Strauss and I, in addition to other similarities that are perceived by the public on occasion between us, we also both have Filson briefcases, and I think of the Filson factory in the Soto neighborhood where it&#39;s not a street-level activation, but it almost could be, where as you kind of go up the stairs to get into Filson, you can sort of look out and see their entire manufacturing area, where they are putting together, you know, Filson briefcases and other things with their manufacturing workforce, so I could see the potential of, you know, a tenant, you know, like Filson or something that moves into a space, and there&#39;s sort of big, you know, windows that open out into the street where the public can kind of look in and watch the manufacturing process. Like, I could see how something like that could have an interaction with the street-level and create a more dynamic street-level space, so I think there could be some potential with the light industrial to spill out and have that kind of effect, so I look forward to queuing this up again at full council and have no objection to holding the amendment until that time or tabling the amendment until that time. Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. That was really well said, and what I&#39;m going to ask colleagues, please convene with Councilmember Lewis before Friday. I&#39;m going to have Mr. Ahn walk the floor to double-check that everyone&#39;s comfortable. This is because Council President has made it very clear that she does not prefer amendments at full council, and so I want to make sure that if we bring an amendment to full council that we do so in short order. You know, I think, Councilmember Lewis, your comments about Filson is correct. As with Filson, as with this bill, you must have the best. You know, got to have the best, and so, you know, one thing that comes to mind there is that we have an office space on Ballard Avenue that has used for office space on the street level, and it has not always had the most active, vibrant storefront, and they have just partnered with the United Indians of all tribes to have their store in the space, and so the office space, the architects share their storefrontage with the United Indians of all tribes to have their storefront there, and it activates that front area, and it allows for the office space, so I think that there are some creative solutions that we can bring to that. Colleagues, seeing no further questions on this one, I&#39;m going to move us on. Please make sure that you have your questions resolved by Friday, and communicate with Mr. Ahn. Moving on, Council Member Lewis, would you like to speak to your third amendment, Lewis Amendment 3? Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. So this amendment, well, I&#39;ll let Ketel go first on this amendment, and then I&#39;ll make some of my comments after central staff kind of cues it up. Sure. So by way of reminder, there are a couple of different decision-makers, if this bill passes, about what street-level uses would be allowed. There&#39;s the SDCI director who would be issuing tenant improvement permits and change of use permits potentially for most of downtown, and then there is the Department of Neighborhoods director who has regulatory authority over use decisions in Pioneer Square. Just also by way of reminder, the international district is not included in this amendment. It is not included in this legislation, so it is exempt. So this proposed amendment, the Lewis Amendment 3, would authorize the director of D.O.N. to administratively make decisions about street-level use dispensations through the bill. It also limits some conditioning authority, so it takes away authority to limit to condition based on traffic, parking, and noise, because those are not, strictly speaking, related to the scale and character of the pedestrian environment, and it also allows office uses as an allowed street-level use in Pioneer Square, subject to percentage of the frontage for large blocks. So that&#39;s what proposed amendment 3 would do, and this amendment is informed in part by discussions with the Department of Neighborhoods. Thank you, Mr. Freeman. I&#39;ll pass this off to Councilmember Lewis as the sponsor. I have a question here, though. Does the conversation about office space from the last amendment bleed into this amendment? I know you just mentioned that it would allow office space. Yeah, I&#39;ll push that over to Ketel first and then jump in. I think Ketel is better positioned to answer that question. So I think it&#39;s sort of a question for you all, actually, I think. It seems like the policy issue is should office be allowed as a part of Pioneer Square, and if the answer to that is yes, then it seems like that may hold true for Pioneer Square and downtown, unless they are distinguishable for some reason, and, you know, there may be different developments proposed in Pioneer Square that could benefit from office development at the street level or office development at the street level might have a deleterious effect in Pioneer Square. I think Sarah Bell from the Department of Neighborhoods is here, and her recommendation is reflected in part, maybe I shouldn&#39;t call it her recommendation, but there&#39;s a proposed modification to Councilmember Lewis&#39;s original concept is reflected here, which is the street level frontage reduction or limitation. Sarah, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything you want to say about how you perceive this may play with development in Pioneer Square. Yeah, no, consistent with your comment. The language there in Amendment 3 regarding office street level office uses in Pioneer Square, that was developed in response essentially to Amendment 2 and Councilmember Lewis&#39;s interest in expanding office uses generally, so it&#39;s not that the Department of Neighborhoods is necessarily advocating for expanded street level office uses in Pioneer Square. We just wanted to make sure if office uses were permitted that there was some sort of, you know, maximum regulation that was applied. And just to clarify, too, to jump in on this, Sarah and Ketel, due to the unique setup of how the Pioneer Square neighborhood is constituted and the role of the Department of Neighborhoods, everything under this amendment would have this additional sort of administrative, you know, gate keeping that the director of the Department of Neighborhoods would hold in granting administrative approval, so it&#39;s a little distinct from our downtown neighborhood discussion because there is still sort of this role where the Department of Neighborhoods director, if he wanted to, could withhold approval of certain things if it was not conforming to, you know, like what we want to see in the neighborhood. So I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case. Yeah. Actually, Gina Nasham is on the phone or on the line and I&#39;m going to ask her to speak more directly to this because she&#39;s the one that coordinates the Pioneer Square Preservation Board within the Department of Neighborhoods. And Gina, maybe you can speak a little bit, you know, kind of what goes before the board at this point and what&#39;s handled administratively and how that may change over the next few months depending on what happens with the emergency COVID protocols. Sure. Right now with the emergency legislation, I only review any use that is identified as a preferred use administratively and any other change of use goes to the board for review. Is there another part of your question that I didn&#39;t answer?
So under this legislation, the office, the street level office pieces, the street level uses, that would be reviewed administratively by you and by Andres, but there are other decisions that are made within the boundaries of the district that are made by the board. It&#39;s not a fully administrative process right now. And the pieces that are administrative would be subject to change once the emergency protocols are lifted. Correct. Thank you. Thank you. That&#39;s very helpful. So Mr. Freeman, can you help me understand is what I&#39;m hearing is that if Lewis amendment 2 office space passes, then that&#39;s what amendment 3 is for or does amendment 3 here have additional expansion? Can you just make that answer that question clearly for the record? Sure. So amendment 3 is specific to the decision-making authority in pioneer square. So this office expansion would just apply in the pioneer square special review district. It would not apply outside of pioneer square. So Lewis amendment 2, which expanded the list of uses to include office, is only applicable in those downtown zones that don&#39;t include pioneer square. So that&#39;s mostly the downtown retail core. It&#39;s pretty much everything that is north of downtown, north of pioneer square in the international district. Is that clear, council member Strauss? So this language in amendment 3 is specific to pioneer square. It would not authorize office as a street level use outside of the pioneer square special review district. So the second part of the question for the record is does this amendment provide other administrative decisions or is it just office space? No. It would allow the actually there&#39;s a distinction here between pioneer square and the rest of downtown in this bill. There is a limitation on the kinds of uses that can be approved in pioneer square. They have to be there&#39;s sort of broader authority for the DON director to approve uses but they don&#39;t necessarily have to be the preferred uses. They have to be the preferred uses that are identified but they can&#39;t include uses that are not otherwise authorized in pioneer square. The SDCI director on the other hand is not subject to that limitation. So the SDCI director can approve uses at a, you know, through that type one decision at the street level that might not even be authorized by the zone provided that they meet the test of providing different services at an activated street level. So as drafted there are already stronger limitations on approving street level uses in pioneer square than there is in the rest of downtown. Okay. Colleagues, do you have other questions? I&#39;m not sure that I support this amendment. I&#39;m not sure that I support this amendment generally. I guess I still have questions about office space. Councilmember Lewis. Right. Just to jump in on this one Councilmember Strauss and maybe Keetle. I think Keetle did just kind of answer this but maybe to put a finer point on it. I think that this amendment just gives a little bit more power to the department of neighborhoods director to move things along that would be helpful. I think there&#39;s a lot of discussion about getting bogged down in a board approval process. You know, like there&#39;s still one thing that&#39;s sort of different I think from the conversation about making office use a broader use in the downtown and south lake union neighborhoods is that there is that kind of layer of administrative approval here from the department of business districts across the city. I mean like we&#39;re getting bogged down a lot in like, you know, office use at the street level. But in most business districts around the city office use is an allowable street level use. It&#39;s partly going back to our first conversation why we&#39;re not discussing, you know, a need to amend urban village business district zoning requirements for example. So, you know, I think it comes down to do we want to give the department of neighborhoods director the ability to administratively approve use requests for street level office use in the pioneer square neighborhood? Is the pioneer square neighborhood more like downtown or more like a neighborhood business district? And, you know, I think that in some respects pioneer square is an interesting intermediary neighborhood where it does have a lot of characteristics in common with downtown. Obviously it bleeds into the downtown neighborhood but it also in a way shares a lot in common with, you know, urban village business district hubs. So I think that we&#39;re just saying with this amendment and I would like to pursue voting on this amendment today if you&#39;re satisfied, Mr. Chair, I do think that just to circle back on it I think that there were a lot of changes that were requested by alliance for pioneer square and other pioneer square stakeholders to really try to get some more tendency and activities in the neighborhood that has really suffered during COVID. And I do think that some of the safeguards and protections that are in place and the diligence of the department of neighborhoods makes me feel confident that we&#39;ll have a vibrant pioneer square with these characteristics. So I think that we should vote on it today. Thank you. I see councilmember Juarez has questions. Can you scroll down to see the final analysis box? Yeah. I&#39;m going to have a problem with this and I&#39;ll tell you why. Councilmember Lewis thank you for providing this. Again, we didn&#39;t have a lot of this information. I guess my concern is that I have the amendments labeled one, two, three and four. Amendments two, three and four don&#39;t have that. So when I refer to that that&#39;s what I&#39;m referring to. So we have agreed to pull back amendment number three which is your amendment number two. And I believe this is just what I think and obviously we&#39;re open for this is why we have committee meetings and have discussion and transparency. I think that your last amendment is legislatively at least connected to amendment, your former amendment. In order for the last amendment, the one you have in front of us to make sense we need to explore and pass the prior one. And I&#39;ll tell you why. Because I was looking at because I didn&#39;t you know some of this I was just trying to catch up and get copies of this. I have some concerns and I have some questions about giving the sole authority to Department of Neighborhoods to make administrative decisions and how those are appealable. What the scope would be and the timing would be if someone were to appeal. I also just have some basic questions on whether it&#39;s 30 feet or 50 or the square footage. Some of us just got this stuff at the last minute. So I&#39;m trying to catch up. I felt comfortable voting on the first amendment because I did get that one. But and also the second one now that I had some things clarified but quite frankly I don&#39;t think I can I don&#39;t want to abstain because I think you deserve a full conversation about this. So I&#39;m not inclined to vote if you want to vote today. I&#39;m not inclined to vote yes on your last amendment because I think it is connected to the one that you&#39;re holding for full counsel. I know that the council president doesn&#39;t like it when we walk on amendments but I would certainly support and have our office encourage the council president and our colleagues to allow you to do this these last two so we have some time with this. Because I really agree with what you&#39;re doing here. You want to reactivate all of this empty space not only in Lake Union but in downtown and other neighborhoods. And it&#39;s a big lift. But I just want to do it right and have the right questions. And right now I can&#39;t really quickly on the fly develop some halfway intelligent questions. So I will leave it at that. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Juarez. I had started with the intention today to pass this bill out. Seeing as it seems like we will have longer. And then my second reaction was let&#39;s send amendments to full counsel if we can keep the conversation short. It does seem like there&#39;s more conversation to be had. Council Member Lewis. Yes. You know, I am happy to give a little bit more time on this amendment as well. I mean, I think for some of the reasons that I shared earlier this amendment is distinct and separate from the other amendment we&#39;ve tabled. But I&#39;m happy to take a little bit more time having that conversation with members of the committee leading up to full counsel. You know, if we can sort of iron out some of those questions, that amendment process might not be time consuming at full counsel. So, you know, I think this has been a good opportunity to solicit feedback from the committee and tinker with these amendments a little bit to iron out some of the issues. So I&#39;m happy to also hold this one to take care of some of the confusion. And then vote on it on Monday if the chair is okay with that. Vice Chair Mosqueda. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I&#39;ll defer to your process and what you feel most comfortable with for today. I did want to signal my support for this last amendment as well and appreciate the conversation. But in case that helps with the future discussions that you all are thinking about either for today or Monday, appreciate this amendment being brought forward. Thank you. And so the sticky position in which I am in is that if we vote this bill out of committee, we cannot bring it back to committee to then make amendments on in the future. And that is a very important issue. And that is so if we were to vote it out today, then that means that all of the questions have to be answered before this coming Monday. Or we can hold the bill until September 8th and pass it out that day. The reason that I had hoped to have it passed today is because September is going to be a very busy month in the land use and neighborhoods committee and there&#39;s not a lot of extra time. And so from the conversation that we&#39;ve had today, it&#39;s clear that there&#39;s more discussion that is needed on both of these amendments. Because Councilmember Lewis, you&#39;re coming from the right place and these are good amendments. We just need to make sure that they&#39;re finally crafted. Right. And just to put a finer point on it too, Councilmember Strauss, it seems like the main contention from what I&#39;m hearing is sort of this concern about street level office space as a potential use. I mean, that seems to be the consistent issue between the two amendments. So if that is somehow dealt with, I don&#39;t think there would be an issue pursuing both of these amendments at full council. I&#39;m not really sensing any other controversy surrounding these two amendments. But I guess I would just maybe ask for that feedback now in consideration. So when we go back to work with Ketel and my staff on this, we can kind of queue up everything that&#39;s a potential issue to committee members to make sure that if we do pursue this at full council, it&#39;s a quick and smooth amendment process instead of something where some of these issues might get litigated again. So I mean, obviously the street level office use is one thing. But if we can do something else committee members want to flag now in open session so we can queue that conversation up for an efficient conversation, this might be a good opportunity to share those things. And that might be better than feeling like we&#39;re putting people in a tight spot to like vote on it today, not comfortably knowing all the implications. Sure. Great. Thank you. And Council Member Juarez, I saw you come off mute. I was going to say, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem. I think it&#39;s a problem. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a big controversy. I think a lot of this we can just answer. You can just brief us offline and we&#39;ll be ready to go. I don&#39;t see it as a, you know, I just want to make sure I understand what I&#39;m doing, that&#39;s all. That&#39;s it. There&#39;s no big thing here. Just, you know, needed to get it sooner and get through some of these questions and the amendments. That was my main concern. And I don&#39;t see a problem. I think we can have some in-depth conversation at full council. So I agree with what Council Member Lewis just shared. Thank you. Great. Then Council Member Lewis, what I&#39;m going to ask is that we&#39;re going to hold your two amendments, amendment three and four or Lewis two and three, however you shall like to note them. And please, let&#39;s work to make sure, and I&#39;m going to have Mr. Ahn follow up with everyone on Friday to make sure that we have a good discussion. We are all in agreement so that we don&#39;t have a long discussion at full council on Monday. So at this time my recommendation is to pass the bill as amended with amendments one and two, Strauss one and Lewis one, to go to full council. We will bring forward Lewis amendments two and three maybe as just one amendment. And there may be changes that need to be made. So I&#39;m going to ask for those amendments between here and there. And all council members on this committee need to feel comfortable. Otherwise we&#39;ll hold that bill until September. Does that sound like a good game plan to everyone? Seeing nods of yes. So I&#39;m going to move to pass council bill 120121 as amended. Is there a second? Second. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. All in favor? Aye. Council member Patterson? Yes. Council member Lewis? Yes. Council member Juarez? Aye. Council member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Strauss? Yes. Five in favor, no opposed. Thank you. The motion carries to pass council bill 120121 as amended. Thank you for the discussion today and thank you council member Lewis for your amendments. We will be back before full council on Monday for a vote. I understand we took a little bit more time with that last bill than expected. Our next item of business is a briefing on council bill 120153. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the abbreviated title into the record. Item two, council bill 120153, an ordinance relating to land use and zoning, adding a new section to the Seattle municipal code to provide alternative development standards for small lots located in downtown mixed residential zones. Thank you. We are joined by the one and only Brennan Staley from the office of community planning development. Brennan, would you like to take us away with what this bill will do? Understanding, colleagues, this is just a briefing today. We&#39;re not voting. So cue up any questions that you have for our next committee meeting. Thank you, Brennan. Take it away. Thank you. Okay. So hopefully you should see the presentation. So I&#39;m here to talk about some proposed changes in the dmr zones of north belltown that are intended to help make it easier to develop on small lots. So the issue is that in these zones, north belltown, they are really represent a great location. Oh, sorry. Yeah, could you dmr, can you explain for the public? Downtown mixed residential zones and we have a map, but it&#39;s about 30 blocks in the north part of belltown. So close to downtown, a lot of amenities, transit, et cetera. But the challenge in building these areas is two things. One, they have a height limit of 145 feet. Once you get above 85 feet, you can no longer do wood construction. You have to do steel and concrete. So it&#39;s more expensive. And at the same time, we have a number of development standards there that require very complicated building shapes that make development impractical on small lots. At the same time, there actually have been a number of advances in innovative construction that are making it much easier to build to these heights. Things like modular construction where you actually kind of build the boxes off site and stack them. On the left, the Emmons picture is a modular construction project in belltown. But also panelized construction where you actually build a grid usually out of metal and then you have pre-made panels that you simply insert into it. And on the right, 303 battery and 47 and 7 are examples of that kind of panelized construction. And so both of these types of construction actually have the possibility to help bring down costs and time and really could be very helpful in this particular setting of these DMR zones in belltown. It&#39;s especially good for heights that are above 85 feet and less than 160 feet and are very useful on small lots. However, they also require building shapes that allow for stacking of units. You can think of them kind of like lego pieces and you need to kind of be able to stack them up. You can&#39;t cut your lego piece in half. And so it needs a little bit more of that simpler building shape. And, of course, these types of constructions not only can make it faster but they can be more sustainable. They use less materials to construct. There are also local manufacturers that are building in great water use and, you know, solar voltaic panels so that they have a lot of opportunity there as well. I should also point out that there&#39;s also another type, cross-laminated timber that at this point is people were not seeing people do that yet but we think in the long term that also could become another type of innovative construction that could be very useful in these types of areas as well. It doesn&#39;t have the same issues of stacking but, again, would benefit from having a simpler shape. So that&#39;s the context. The intended goal of this legislation is simply to create more appropriate development standards for small lots in order to create more additional housing in belltown generally and then also to support these new types of innovative construction that can help bring down costs and meet long-term goals. So how do we develop this proposal? We actually started this with initial conversations with builders in early 2019 that had these new types of innovative construction and we&#39;re finding a lot of barriers in this area in particular. We did outreach in the summer of 2019 to a number of local groups belltown community council, belltown business association, denny triangle neighborhood association, the downtown Seattle association. We also met with a couple local developers and some local property owners. We then released an updated proposal as well as our SEPA, our state environmental policy act environmental analysis in February of 2020, and then the project was put on hold due to the pandemic. So it is some unique situation in that the proposal hasn&#39;t actually changed for more than a year, but it was put on hold obviously because of other issues that were occurring during that period. So in terms of where this would apply, so again this would apply in the downtown mixed residential zones of belltown where areas that have those that have the height limits of 145 feet. You can see on this map the areas in gray are the areas where this would apply. That includes about 33 blocks in this northern portion. In those areas the sites would have to be less than 14,500 square feet. In belltown this was an area that was developed with lots about 6,400 square feet. They were essentially kind of a larger than average single family lot. And so it basically would be kind of what we call single lots or double lots, so either kind of those one single family home lot or two of them put together. So only those smaller lots where this would apply. And the buildings would have to be at least 75% residential. In these areas almost all buildings are residential so that is not a major limiting but we don&#39;t want to encourage more office in these areas. We want to encourage residential. So on the map you can actually see highlighted in colors all the lots that where this might be applicable. The orange ones are these kind of smaller single lots and the blue ones are the larger double lots. So there are 24 individual sites in this area. And we did do an analysis of what exists on those sites today. We were especially worried about displacement and as we did an analysis we found there was actually no residential uses of any kind on those sites. And so we&#39;re not worried about residential displacement so these are primarily one story commercial buildings. Obviously if they&#39;re demolished that could result in some lower amount of commercial but generally in these areas not all of them people generally build retail on the first floor. So it would obviously be potentially more expensive space but not probably less of it. But again no residential buildings would be likely to be demolished because of this proposal. And Brennan do you know what is exactly existing on these current lots? And maybe that would be helpful for the next committee meeting only because you just zeroed in on something that&#39;s incredibly important is that we need more residential space downtown. The reason that downtown feels empty right now is because we have an overabundance of office space and an underabundance of residential. And so bringing more people to live downtown is what will make downtown thrive and I think that this is one of those ways of doing this. So you don&#39;t need to answer now you answered my question at the high level which is that it&#39;s either reducing residential to replace residential or simply increasing residential. And I think I heard you say it right before I jumped in. Would storefronts be allowed on the first floor? Yes. In basically all these areas you can do retail on the ground floor and in some of the areas it&#39;s required to do retail on the ground floor. Great. Thank you. So the proposal itself so basically the idea is to allow these small lots in the north belltown that would be a slightly simpler shape. And basically the idea is by having a slightly simpler shape it allows for the stacking of units that would allow innovative construction techniques to be used and would make it much easier to develop on these small lots. And that really is two things. So basically we reduced the number of required upper level setbacks and currently the requirement is that you have to have two breaks where it gets smaller and we reduced that to one. And we allow upper floors to be slightly larger while requiring lower floors to be slightly smaller. So overall would not increase the size of the building. So floor area or height. It would simply allow for a simpler shape. And I think it&#39;s important to note that the regulations we have here are really unique in the city of Seattle. Other than one specific zone in south downtown we don&#39;t usually require this kind of complicated wedding shape. So wedding cake shape you might call it. So this would really be making these standards much more similar to other parts of the city. Something you just said, Brennan, that I want to highlight is that there&#39;s not a change to FAR, floor area ratio or height. Simply the shape. Thank you. And so I do have kind of four examples just to kind of bring home what that means. On the right here we have what is probably the most extreme example. The small lot that already has green street setbacks. And you can see just from the form how again it requires those two different breaks and it gets skinnier. On the right our proposal would reduce that to one break. That break would happen much lower to the ground. So again the bottom floors would be skinnier. The top floors would be a little bit wider. Yeah. So this is one example. I have another example of what this means on another single lot that doesn&#39;t have a green street. And this is going to be the majority of cases in Belltown. And you can see here where there isn&#39;t that green street setback, development tends to go to the street anyway. And so the differences we&#39;re proposing really would only affect what generally would be in kind of a light well on the other side. So you can see from the street in most cases the building would look exactly the same either way but the light wells which you can see kind of on the bottom half would be different. So it would be a much easier shape to do but wouldn&#39;t affect in most cases what you see from the street. I think it is also important to note again for green streets we&#39;re only allowing those changes on the north side. So overall this should not have a significant difference either way on the amount of light that&#39;s coming in. And also I really want to point out that again on these existing rules nobody is building these buildings today. That is fundamentally the issue that they&#39;re so complicated that people aren&#39;t really able to build them. So we don&#39;t actually these kind of existing examples I&#39;m showing you are totally theoretical because nobody feels they can build them today. So really the purpose is mostly to allow development at all on these sites. So this is one of the examples on a double lot. And again as you can see how it is a simpler shape. More breaks. And then on a double lot without a green street again similarly you don&#39;t notice much change on most of the building but the change really occurs on how it&#39;s spaced from the building next door. So there&#39;s, you know, space going down to a lower level and it&#39;s not a big deal. Great. Thank you, Brennan. Colleagues, other questions for Brennan? Vice chair Mosqueda. Thank you so much. Yeah, I think changing the code requirements so that it&#39;s easier to build makes all the sense in the world. I don&#39;t think that most folks see a huge difference between one or two setbacks in the images that you shared and if we can build more housing and store more housing all the better. I just want to confirm, though, even though this legislation would allow for different types and alternative building models including modules, that doesn&#39;t preclude someone coming in from using a steel frame who is using union work on site from being able to build to these new heights and new setback accommodations. Is that correct? Yeah, thank you very much. So one, it does not require a certain kind of construction and I think any kind of construction would benefit from these changes. I think innovative construction obviously is essentially not feasible under the current rules but we&#39;re also not seeing any other kind of construction either. So I think any kind of construction would benefit. And I also want to point out that these are kind of optional standards so you&#39;ll continue to be able to develop under what&#39;s in the code or you can use this if you prefer. So, yes, this should kind of benefit kind of all types of construction. Great. Thank you, Brennan. Any other questions there, vice chair? Looking good. Councilmember Lewis. Thank you so much. So I&#39;m really excited about this proposal as someone who walks around the Belltown neighborhood on a very regular basis and sees a lot of those typically empty parking lots just kind of sitting there with potential for infill development that is currently not happening. I think this is a great pro-density strategy. I do also just want to briefly mention some of the potential climate benefits in being able to pursue as was alluded to earlier at a new scale and a new level and to incentivize in a bigger way cross-laminated timber construction as a more viable option in the Belltown neighborhood. I think that it&#39;s really important that we continue to try to emphasize in our built environment the use of building materials that we know have a demonstrably way lower carbon footprint especially as we continue to see the truly dramatic impact that climate change is having on our region and the world and especially with this summer of unprecedented wildfires in the west. And, you know, I appreciate having this conversation today because I feel like we as a committee have are moving forward a little bit on a new policy that has climate implications and like every morning where we can do that as a council and talk about that as a council I think it&#39;s a good morning to continue to move the ball forward on ways we can be more sustainable and do our part to combat climate change.
Property. Of the neighborhood use committee. I&#39;m going to call the roll. Councilmember Juarez? here. Councilmember Mercado? here. Present? Present. Thank you. As always the land use and neighborhoods committee of the city of Seattle begins our meetings with land acknowledgement. We will take a moment to pause as we acknowledge. We are on the traditional and tribal land. We are on the land of the people of this land. People past and present are represented in a number of tribes and as urban natives. We honor with gratitude the land itself and the people of this land. We start with this acknowledgement to recognize that we are guests on this land and need to steward our land as such as guests. This is not a checklist or rote behavior. It doesn&#39;t give us a passport to proceed however we desire to proceed. We recognize that we are guests on this land and ensure that we steward our work as guests as our time is short. We have five items on today&#39;s agenda. All of which have public hearings and briefings. This is a fairly long committee meeting. We will be following up with another committee meeting this coming Friday. One of the items today may have a vote if councilmembers would like to vote on the items on the agenda. We will be following up with another committee meeting this coming Friday. Let me go through the list. We have council bill 120149 which increases the maximum size limit for sports and recreation uses in industrial general two zones. Second, we have council bill 120154 which makes several annual amendments to the comprehensive plan. We have third, council bill 120155 which also amends the comprehensive plan to change the name of single family areas to neighborhood residential areas. Fourth, we have council bill 120181 which is a comprehensive plan to increase the maximum size limit for sports and recreation uses for small lots in belltown to allow for modular construction. This is the item which we may vote on today if councilmembers are comfortable since we have already had this bill presented to us in this committee. Lastly and fifth, we have council bill 120181 which adopts a regional transferable development rights program with Pierce and Snohomish county. Again, the next meeting of the land use and neighborhoods committee will take place tomorrow. I ask that everyone be patient. Before we begin, if there is no objection, the agenda will be adopted. Hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted. At this time, we will open the remote public comment period for items on today&#39;s agenda. Before we begin, I ask that everyone please be patient as we learn to operate the system in realtime. Please keep in mind that these are separate public hearings for each item on today&#39;s agenda. If you are speaking to one of those items, please reserve your comments as you are speaking to the other items. Please keep in mind that those are not necessarily included. Let me actually check with the clerk. Do we need to run through the script if no one is signed up for public comment? » council member Strauss, if you would like to confirm with I.T. that there are no public commenters, you may proceed to the next business item. » thank you. » there are currently no public comment registrants. » thank you. Seeing as we have no speakers signed up nor remotely present, the public comment period is now closed and we will move on to the next agenda item. I would like the record to reflect we have been joined by council member Lewis. » thank you. I would like the record to reflect we have been joined by council member Lewis. » thank you. » today is a public hearing and briefing and discussion on council bill 120149 which increases the maximum size of sports and recreation uses in industrial general two zones. Mr. On will you please read the title into the record. » thank you. I would like to remind all members of the public that we will hear from members of the mayor&#39;s office, OPCD and council central staff. We are now going to move into the remote public hearing on council bill 120149. Before we open the remote public hearing I would ask everyone to be patient as we continue to learn to operate the system in real time and with the right tools and resources. I will now call the public hearing to order. I will moderate the public hearing in the following manner. Each speaker will be given two minutes to speak. I will call on one speaker at a time in the order you registered on the website. If you have not yet registered to speak you can sign up before the end of the public hearing. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item you are addressing. Again as a reminder public comment should relate right now to council bill 120149. If you have comments about something that is not on today&#39;s agenda you can provide written comments by e-mailing my office. Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are remaining of your allotted time. We ask you to begin to wrap up the public hearing. If you have any questions or comments you would like us to answer please do so via the chat function. The speaker&#39;s microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next speaker. Once you have completed your public comment we ask that you disconnect from the line and if you plan to continue following this meeting please do so via the Seattle channel or listening to the chat function. Thank you. I see we have five people signed up and one person not present. I have Virginia Gilder, Sue Bird, Michael Sung, Irene Wall and Laura Lowe. Good morning, Jenny. We have you up. Good morning. I&#39;m assuming you can hear me. As you said I&#39;m Jenny Gilder and I&#39;m an owner of the Seattle Storm. The city has supported T-Mobile Park and the soon-to-reopen climate pledge arena in myriad ways. The brand-new crack and practice facility recently opened at Northgate for a brand-new team. Now the city has an opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to equity, to step forward and extend that tradition of support to its sole professional women&#39;s sports franchise, the Seattle Storm. The storm provides significant public benefit to our community. Of course we offer basketball clinics for youth, but that&#39;s just the start. Our force for change initiative focuses on voter education, supporting BIPOC youth and communities, amplifying black women and promoting BIPOC businesses. We have a long history of engagement with the LGBTQ community. We have a long history of engagement with the LGBTQ community. We have a long history of engagement with the LGBTQ community. Together with our many corporate partners, we have raised and donated hundreds of thousands of dollars just in the past two years to support our city through a particularly rough time. Everything we do reflects our community&#39;s values of equity, and we are committed to supporting our pro sports franchises to the storm so we can continue to represent you, winning on the court and promoting the power of equity everywhere else. Thank you so much. Thank you, Ginny. Up next we have Sue Bird followed by Michael Sung, who is not present. Michael, if you are here, please call in now. Hi, everyone. My name is Sue Bird. I have been a WNBA franchise manager here in Seattle since 2002 and have been a part of all four of the championship teams. The way I see it, my teammates and I, we have always given our best both on and off the court in order to rep the city right and to maintain the status as best WNBA franchise, obviously in my opinion. Now we are hoping the city will do the same. I have seen a lot change in this league and there has definitely been a shift recently. When I look at that changing landscape, the importance of top class facilities to attract free agents and compete with other franchises is crucial. Last year is a great example, sadly. The sad part is that we lost some players. The good part is we won the championship. There is a ton of reasons for players to leave and make that decision, but facilities in other franchises help tip the scale for them. In order to win rings and hoist trophies, you need great players and without a practice facility of our own, we lack the resources that are critical to sustain that championship level. That goes for on the court as well as off the court in our community. It would not only communicate a commitment to women and girls who are not accustomed to seeing women&#39;s sports highlighted or put on an equal footing with men. I haven&#39;t seen that in my time. That could be even more important than raising trophies. I urge you to approve the code amendment and thank you for your time. Thank you, Sue. Good luck on Sunday. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Absolutely. Knock them dead. Michael, I see you are not present at this time. I&#39;m going to move on to Irene Wall and then Laura Lowe. Michael, if you are listening, please do call in. Irene, good morning. Thank you. My name is Irene Wall. I strongly urge you to reject this code amendment. It is not a code amendment. It is not disguised as a code amendment. The disguise is about as transparent as a Groucho Marx mask from Archie McPhee&#39;s. Ask yourself why this code change even surfaced now. Did the parks department ask to put in an indoor sports facility? No. Did anyone besides Ginny Gilder ask for this? Did the city council recently said close the loopholes that have allowed too many non-industrial uses to usurp limited IG zone land? Instead, the mayor wants to reopen a new loophole. FCC Insights story yesterday has clearly spelled out the illegalities and irregularities behind this obvious spot rezone. Read it before you vote on this. Instead, insist that this request go through the contract rezone process. The Seattle storm can have a practice facility in a commercial zone elsewhere in the city. Given the stated public benefits of opening the facility to BIPOC kids, placing it in inner bay between Queen Anne and Magnolia is a striking contradiction. If the goal is some parity between men and women&#39;s professional sports, then the storm practice field belongs in the stadium district. Famous basketball fan Chris Hanson has a lot of spare property there, and if you&#39;re going to degrade an industrial area land for sports, this is the obvious place to do it, not in Ben Mick. Thank you. Thank you, Irene. Up next, we have Laura Lowe. Good morning, Laura. Hello, everybody. My name is Laura, and I&#39;m part of an organization called share the city&#39;s action fund. We did a walking tour with our education side this week with 18 folks through the inner bay area in the middle of a thunderstorm and had a robust discussion about the future of our industrial lands. There&#39;s a lot of enthusiasm in the community, and folks are just learning about the industrial maritime strategy. When we contrast the process of this storm facility and the decisions that were made last week, it seems very obscure and different than other processes I followed on land. For example, the housing above the grocery store were years of scrutiny, endless design review for a handful of cranky neighbors to have their say. Meanwhile, this practice facility and area the city had supposedly a north star of prioritizing maritime and industrial middle wage jobs has gotten a faster and more robust response. I absolutely love the storm, champion our great women&#39;s basketball team, proud to have them in our city. They absolutely deserve a new practice facility, but as the land use committee looks to how we make our industrial maritime strategy and our residential zoning changes over the next comprehensive plan update, just think about how this process is in contrast to the housing that we need and the housing crisis and how slow that is and how quickly and seemingly without a lot of public knowledge or even the planning commission understanding what was going on, this has moved forward. So, yeah, just really look into that. I agree with the last speaker in terms of reading that SBC insight article, and there&#39;s even more that wasn&#39;t even mentioned in that article to dig into. So thank you. Thank you, Laura. And I&#39;ve received information that Michael Sung called into the wrong line. So I am going to give us just a second to see if we&#39;re able to have him join the correct phone line to be able to provide his public comment during this public hearing. I see Michael is now present. Good morning, Michael. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Michael Michael Michael Michael son Michael son I see you&#39;re good morning. Good morning. My apologies. My name is Michael My name is Michael song and I live roughly 1000 feet from the nearest pumps and people on the property. There areificant major impacts to families directly impacted by this proposal. I strongly advocate for these. While I would like to say I&#39;m raising brazing children. Building happens and I think you only need to look at the early success of an exemplary facility. I signed my son up for the hockey program and I was astonished at the uses just last night. Immediately prior to my son&#39;s program the ice was filled with 50 racially diverse toddlers. Immediately afterwards the lobby and dressing rooms were filled with women and children. I strongly urge this community to advance this ordinance today as proposed so the residents on the west side of town can see development for the benefit of health and wellness. The impact of a reduction in industrial land is negligible. I sincerely hope this committee places a higher priority on the well-being of the residents and their families.

That was our last speaker remotely present to speak at this public hearing. The public hearing on council bill 120149 is now closed. Thank you to everyone who provided public testimony today. We are now going to transition to the presentation. Adrian Thompson. I am Adrian Thompson. I am sorry, I thought I had you. I am Adrian Thompson, the policy director for Mayor. Rico Kidding. I am the interim director of planning and community development. Good morning, Jeff Wentland, office of planning and community development. Good morning, Jeff. Great to have you here. Please take us away with the presentation. Great. I can kick us off. Adrian Thompson, policy director for Mayor. I want to thank you, chair Strauss and members of the committee to present this morning to you an exciting opportunity. On behalf of Mayor, we are excited to welcome you to the city of San Francisco. Before we get into the presentation and the team will go into more of the details, I wanted to provide you all a high-level overview of why the Mayor transmitted this legislation. We as a city have looked for ways to support sports and recreational facilities in the same way we have prioritized the stadium district, home to men&#39;s sports team, and the Cracken. Over the past several administrations, there has been a healthy tension within the maritime and industrial community, residents, housing, and others to determine the future of our industrial lands. The Mayor convened over the past two years through COVID-19, a stakeholder engagement process that produced a set of recommendations that strengthened to protect our industrial lands. Working directly with stakeholders and city council, OPCD has moved forward on CEPA, will conduct a comprehensive EIS study, and intends to transmit legislation to be taken up by council later this year. We have also heard from some stakeholders that we as a city need to find more ways to support sports and recreational facilities. This legislation before you today that you&#39;re considering is compatible with both the goal to support sports and recreational facilities. The goal of this legislation is to create an indoor recreational facility to enable sports facilities in very limited industrial uses. Compared to other uses, such as large offices and retail developments, indoor sports and recreation does not create as much of a demand for trips and visits by non-industrial users. This legislation does not apply to spectator sports facilities. It does not apply to industrial structures. Further, the limiting criteria contained in the legislation prevents location of an indoor sports and recreation facility anywhere in the bulk of industrial or maritime zone lands. By passing this legislation, sports teams such as the Seattle Storm, which has not historically had an advocate in City Hall, will have more options available to build local facilities. Thank you. Thank you, Adrian. My comments will be brief as I want to turn it over to our expert, Jeff Wendland. I appreciate the audience today. I appreciate the conversation. I know that you probably have a number of questions that need to be answered, which I think our presentation today will answer some of them. I look forward to discussion thereafter. I have been very proud to be involved in our industrial and maritime strategy work with our stakeholders and what we&#39;ve lifted up in terms of the 11 strategies that we are now seeing forward legislation this year and our EIS process. A lot of great work ahead. I think that the legislation that we&#39;re speaking about today is not inconsistent with that larger body of work. With that, I want to hand over to Jeff to pull up the very short slide deck that we have to provide some additional information for you to consider. Thank you, Rico. Do you all see the slides and can you hear me? Yes to both. Great. I will be providing you with a very brief overview of the proposed legislation. Here is a summary of what&#39;s contained in the legislation. The proposal would increase the maximum size of use limit for indoor sports and recreational uses in industrial general zones from a current 10,000 square feet maximum to a 50,000 square foot maximum. Legislation includes several limiting criteria that are intended to minimize any potential adverse impact on our manufacturing and industrial centers. Those criteria are as follows. It would have to be located in the Ballard-Interbay North End Manufacturing Industrial Center. The facility would have to be within 300 feet of an existing neighborhood commercial or Seattle mixed zone. That targets potential locations to the edges of industrial areas near mixed use neighborhoods. The facility would have to be within a quarter mile of a Seattle Park with active recreation use. So this is intended to create functional clusters of recreational facilities. The facility could not be within 500 feet of a shoreline and that&#39;s to preserve shoreline areas for maritime uses which are prioritized. And a facility, a new facility, could not be within one mile of another indoor sports and recreation facility larger than 25,000 square feet that would be using this provision. So this would prevent proliferation of too many facilities in one area. The legislation would also decrease the amount of required parking from one space per 500 square feet to one space per 2,000 square feet. And this is intended to minimize the amount of expansive surface parking that would be associated with the facility. The benefits of this proposal are as has been discussed, creates potential new recreational and training opportunities for athletics and camps. And the limiting criteria minimize impacts on nearby industrial activities. And as was mentioned, indoor sports and recreation can be compatible with an industrial context compared to many other potential uses. Lastly, here is just a map that was included in the director&#39;s report. This shows how limited the potentially eligible areas are. So the gray shade on this map, and please note that north is to the right of your screen, are the industrial general zones in the bin mic, the hatched area are the shoreline buffers where a facility could not be located. The green indicates parks that have active recreational uses. And the last, the blue with the yellow outline, shows the remaining eligible areas according to our analysis. And with that, I will conclude the presentation. Thank you, Jeff. I have a few questions about the proposal. I have a few questions. I&#39;ve got three questions, and then I&#39;ll pass it to colleagues. Whomever desires can answer. It&#39;s my understanding that sports and recreation facilities are already allowed in industrial general two zones. Am I correct that this proposal does not change or add new uses to industrial general two? Is that correct? That is correct. And this legislation, I guess, let me focus in. This legislation, since you just mentioned, is not changing uses. It&#39;s my understanding this legislation simply changes the size of a use that is already allowed. Is that correct? That is also correct. It increases from 10,000 to 50,000. Okay. And when I was reading your director&#39;s report, was I correct in reading that there are up to 45 parcels that could be affected by this change? Yes. Okay. Those are my questions for now. Colleagues, do you have questions? Mr. Chair? Council Member Juarez. I don&#39;t have any questions yet. Well, I have a few, but some of them are just more technical from thanking Lish and everybody and OPCD and all the memos that you put in the ordinance, fiscal note, all that stuff. Thank you very much. Do you want us to speak to this now? Because that&#39;s what I was wondering. I do want to speak to this, but I want to know if the presentation was over or if this is the time you want us to do it or if this is just for questions about the PowerPoint. This is, I would say, both. So if you have something you&#39;d like to say, take it away. There&#39;s a lot I&#39;ve got to say, but I want to make sure everybody has their say before I say anything more. I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re going to vote, and I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re doing that. So I was looking for your leadership, Mr. Chair. Copy. We will be voting on this on Friday, not today. As per usual, I like to have items in my committee at least twice before voting. So I saw Council Member Peterson might have questions. He&#39;s got questions, and then we&#39;ll come back to you, Council Member Juarez. Okay. Thank you. I think I&#39;m going to start my presentation today with the public hearing and discussion and then giving us some time between that to actually vote on it. And I very much... I want to support the Seattle storm. I agree with Sue Bird&#39;s comments about the need to lift up women&#39;s sports in our city. From an urban planning perspective, this land use legislation seems to be structured well with the limitations and setbacks and other restrictions. I am concerned, though, about the issues raised by Kevin Schofield on his City Council blog, SCC Insight. So I want to make sure that when we get to Friday, at least for myself, I want to make sure we&#39;re doing what&#39;s appropriate and not creating any risk to the city, undue risk to the city. So I will be consulting with the City Attorney&#39;s Office between now and then, so I really appreciate the time to just double-check a couple things. So that&#39;s... And I guess the question for central staff would be, you know, their memo. Thank you for that memo. It was very helpful. It doesn&#39;t mention the Seattle storm, so I&#39;m just sort of trying to reconcile is this about the Seattle storm or is it just... It provides a general change to the code. I guess that&#39;s for Mr. Whitson. So as you heard in testimony, the idea was raised by the Seattle storm, but the provisions of the bill would apply to multiple sites, including many properties not owned by the storm ownership. Thank you. Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Councilmember. Lish, can you confirm, has this bill been reviewed by the law department? All legislation that comes to committee has been reviewed by the law department, yes. Okay. Great. Thank you. Councilmember Juarez? I should also add it was also reviewed by me, so there you go, Councilmember Peterson. And Lish, again, as usual, thank you for your great memo and your analysis, and we&#39;ve been working on this legislation or discussing different places. I just wanted to do a little background on history. This conversation didn&#39;t just pop up. I don&#39;t get my information or research from writers, whether it&#39;s Kevin, The Times, Publicola, I don&#39;t do that, so I actually do my own work. Let me just roll back something quickly, and I&#39;ll have more to say Friday when we vote, and I will say this again. Miss Gilder does own the property, so this is private property, and we know that. And what is wrong if it is about the Seattle Storm? When we deal with and when we dealt with any of our major sports teams, nobody ever questions that. That question never comes up. Ever. But I&#39;m going to take us back to the time machine just for a moment for you all to think about this when we vote on Friday. Those of us that were here in May of 2016, those of us that voted against a street vacation, Councilmember Bagshaw, Councilmember Sawant, Councilmember Gonzalez, Councilmember Herbold and myself, and spent 18 months getting death and rape threats because we did our research and we believed that taxpayers, the public should not have a street taken away from them, a private use for private benefit, and we didn&#39;t believe the public benefit was that great. It was a street vacation. It was going to require taxpayer money. I could go on and on. When people keep bringing up that situation that happened in 2016, that&#39;s not what we&#39;re dealing with today. We&#39;re dealing with a group of people that already own the property to expand a footprint for a use that&#39;s already consistent. We&#39;re not talking about thousands of people coming in to watch a spectator sport. It&#39;s a training facility for a team, which we didn&#39;t have in 2016, that has won four national championships. You all know that. I won&#39;t go into there. There&#39;s a difference between shovel ready, which was said in 2016, which was not true, and shovel hungry. What we have here is shovel ready. I don&#39;t want to spend too much time belaboring about yes, it&#39;s important that we support women&#39;s sports and all of those issues, of course, and we&#39;ll hear probably more from more people Friday. This wasn&#39;t some nefarious deal behind closed doors. I&#39;d like to know where these backdoor rooms are, where there&#39;s smoke being, cigars being smoked, because I haven&#39;t been there. It&#39;s been pretty straightforward. We have worked really well with our labor brothers and sisters, with our friends at the port, with our maritime friends, with stakeholders. I also sit on Sound Transit, so I understand what Sound Transit&#39;s, some of their concerns were about potential issues with light rail, which would be 16 years from now. We know that there&#39;s thousands of parcels that Sound Transit has to look at to make anything happen with eminent domain so that we just don&#39;t know. We&#39;re at 10% design there. I don&#39;t want to go down that hole, because I know there&#39;s more information that will come out, and you all have it. It&#39;s all on the record. If anybody wants it from my office, people have already asked for it. I&#39;m one of those people where if you ask for something, I give it to you. You don&#39;t need to PDR me to death. Got nothing to hide. One thing I&#39;m just going to say, one last thing, and I don&#39;t know who the gentleman was, but what he said about when we look at our different districts, and we look at what economic vitality is, and what particular buildings, it isn&#39;t just the brick and mortar. It is a sense of place. It is about what it brings. The Kraken Iceplex, having light rail, having our John Lewis Bridge, all that coming together does more than just provide transportation or a place to go watch the Kraken practice or put on ice skates. It brings a sense of place. It activates a community. It does that with everything that we need. I don&#39;t think anyone here today or anyone watching can not say that the storm has not lifted us, that they have not represented us, that they have not been there for us. I don&#39;t have a problem saying or questioning, why can&#39;t it be for the Seattle storm? Because we sure as hell tried to do it back in 2016 when we didn&#39;t even have a team, and we weren&#39;t even in the franchise.
We weren&#39;t even in the running, and this city went crazy for a team that left them 14 years when we have a team here now. That&#39;s one for national championships. I know I&#39;m probably going to get a lot of hate now, like I got last time. Bring on the death threats again. Great. With that being said, being a lawyer myself, and I&#39;ll just say this boldly and bluntly, it&#39;s not a spot zone. Have fun with that. I&#39;ll just leave it at that, and hopefully, I was hoping we could go to a vote today and just get this over with, but if we need to go to a vote today, that&#39;s fine too, and I&#39;m going to encourage those of you who want to step up and support not just the Seattle storm, but really women&#39;s sports and doing that because we don&#39;t do that, and we should do that, and shame on us for not doing that, and I&#39;ll leave it at that. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Juarez. Well said, and the parcels that could be, we have a list of potential parcels, 45 parcels in three different zones. Those zones are in District 6 and in District 7. Council Member Lewis, the District Council Member from District 7, is a member of this committee. Council Member Lewis, take it away. Thank you, Council Member Strauss. Unfortunately, appearing by phone today, but definitely happy to be heard out on this. I first want to just say at the top, I&#39;m a very big supporter of this change, and I don&#39;t want to get into responding to and litigating any of the armchair lawyering that might have been out in the world on this. I actually concur with Council Member Juarez&#39;s assessment that this is not a spot zone, and I would stand by that as well and totally agree. I&#39;d rather just pivot this and talk, since I do represent District 7, more about the unique ecosystem of the business community that is north of Dravis, east of the railway grade, and west of 15th Avenue. The little slice of Interbay that we&#39;re discussing about, because to agree with Council Member Juarez again, this isn&#39;t just about the storm, but if folks are going to make it about the storm, let&#39;s put that front and center and talk not just about the big civic contributions the storm makes to our city, but the contributions that the storm&#39;s plans for a parcel in this niche, in this part of the Interbay neighborhood will do for the overall neighborhood. So, you know, I think that it&#39;s really important when we talk about industrial communities, and I think that Council Member Strauss, like you, who grew up in Ballard, and grew up in a Ballard that was very much dominated by the maritime industrial community, and knows that that community builds strong families, that that community provides good jobs, that it provides upward mobility, that it provides opportunity, that it produces one of the biggest fishing fleets for one of the biggest fisheries in the world. And I think that we do want to hang on to that critical industrial core, because once we lose it, it&#39;s never coming back. And I think it is appropriate that we have these discussions when we look at potentially doing different things in places that historically have been dedicated to industrial maritime use, that there be a heightened level of policy scrutiny. So, like, let&#39;s just talk a little bit about what it will do to change the activation to that site in this neighborhood. We&#39;re not displacing any current industrial use. This is not a site that is a shipyard. This is not a site that is employing maritime jobs. No maritime jobs are going to be lost from the Seattle Storm putting a practice facility in the site. This site is a single storage yard with a bunch of old RVs and boats, pleasure boats for the most part, not boats of industry that for decades has either been bad or it&#39;s been a vacant lot, completely unactivated, no interest in a tenant taking on this site. And if we&#39;re talking about creating the dynamic neighborhoods and communities that Councilmember Juarez just alluded to, we need to be creative in looking at ways for our code to take advantage of and be adaptive to the changes that are going to happen in this neighborhood. We&#39;re going to bring in legacy tenants that are going to undeniably make a big contribution to neighborhoods like this storm practice facility. This is a neighborhood that&#39;s seeing an incredibly large amount of change. I don&#39;t know if anyone has been by the intersection of 15th and Dravis for some time, but there are significant clusters there of businesses that have been active in this neighborhood for many decades with a number of businesses that cater to the surrounding neighborhood, not just for maritime industrial purposes, but for basic retail, for grocery and for restaurants. And it is frankly not the best use for this business district to have a static storage yard sitting there, not contributing to the activation of the neighborhood, not contributing to the density of job opportunity, not contributing to the density of pedestrian traffic in the business district. Frankly, not contributing to the sense of public safety by having another activation with eyes on the street for potential criminal activity in the neighborhood. We know that people that work in a neighborhood or live in a neighborhood are the most likely to be impacted by this kind of activity and activation. So I think when we&#39;re really looking at what is this going to do for this ecosystem that is, again, north of Dravis, west of 15th, east of the railway grade, this is undeniably going to form a hub right at the center of it that is going to have an extremely positive impact on supporting, in terms of going back to the legislation more broadly and not focusing on the specific site that has been a matter of public contention, that there are safeguards that protect the most critical of our industrial lands which are the shoreline littoral industrial spaces. And I do agree. That has to be a bright red line in the sand on making sure that we never give up as a city any more of our shoreline industrial space, any of our shipyards, any of our places to dock the fishing fleet and fishermen&#39;s terminal. Once those properties on the water are gone and go to a commercial or a residential use, we never get it back for our legacy maritime industrial economy. But that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about here. And to reinforce that value, there is a rule in the legislation that states that the maritime business districts have to be 500 feet away from a shoreline in order to maintain and really reinforce that value. I think that this legislation is going to have a positive impact on my district, going to have a positive impact on Interbay, and it is going to enhance and protect these maritime business districts. It is not going to make any difference to the maritime industry. I do want to say a few words assessments earlier. I did come today prepared to vote on this. I am totally happy to defer and vote on this and discuss it again on Friday. Totally happy to make space for other committee members to receive professional legal advice from the city attorney&#39;s office. But on Friday I do intend to vote for this legislation. I certainly appreciate the opportunity to do so. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. I look forward to supporting this. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. Thank you, Councilmember Juarez and Peterson for your comments and questions. I just want to highlight and raise up a few things that I have heard today. I heard from Sue Bird that the landscape of WNBA has changed. We have lost a number of players for different reasons. In the last few years we need to make sure that on Sunday when Sue and the entire team is representing Seattle in the playoffs, for the WNBA representing Seattle as a four-time champion winner, that our teammates have their minds focused on the game and not thinking about what&#39;s going to happen after the playoff season. Not thinking about what&#39;s going to happen next year because they know that Seattle has got their back. That&#39;s a very important thing that we need to make sure because as Councilmember Juarez stated, we were about to bend over backwards for a team that left us and was not present. We have a four-time winning championship team here. I look forward to supporting our team to win us some playoff games. That&#39;s how I&#39;m feeling this morning. Colleagues, any other questions? Adrian, Lish, Jeff, Director Kirendongo, any other comments that you want to share today? Nothing more for me. Looking forward to the vote on Friday. Thank you. Thank you. Again, thank you for the discussion today. We will be back before the committee on Friday afternoon for a possible vote. Our next item of business is Council Bill 120154, which makes annual amendments to the comprehensive plan. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the abbreviated title into the record? Item two, Council Bill 120154, an ordinance relating to land use and zoning amending the Seattle comprehensive plan to incorporate changes proposed as part of the 2021 comprehensive plan annual plan. Thank you. We are joined by presenters from OPCB and Council Central staff. Will you each introduce yourself? Michael Huggins, Long Range Planning Manager and Office of Planning and Community Development. Sorry. We were having some noise. I can&#39;t hear myself. We have a couple of people here. We have a couple of people here. We have a couple of people here. Let&#39;s try that. Michael, if you would like to reintroduce yourself and then go around the table. Thank you. Good morning, Council members. There is in attendance, Michael Hubner. With the Office of Planning and Community Development. Good morning. My name is Jim Holtz. I&#39;m also with the Office of Planning and Community Development. Thank you. And Eric McConaghy, Council Central Staff. Thank you. We still have Director Kierndongo with us. If we could take away and go start with the presentation. Or the conversation. Let me share my screen here. Let me know when you see the presentation. We have it up. Great. All right. Yeah, well today we are. Recommending that 2021 annual amendments. To the comprehensive plan. To give you a quick background in September, 2020. City council adopted a docking resolution with a proposed amendments. OPCD analyzed for the docketed amendments did not analyze the remaining four amendments. We are recommending two amendments for adoption at this time. One set of amendments related to land is undergoing further study. One docketed amendment is not recommended. And then we&#39;re here today for you guys to consider the amendments. So the first amendment we are recommending is an expansion of the university district urban center. It&#39;s located about a half block on the far north end. About by an alley between university way, northeast and 15th Avenue, northeast. Northeast 56th street to the south. And we&#39;re available to the north. It&#39;s currently zoned LR three. Provides a very marginal increase in potential density for apartments with this change. The second amendment we are recommending is an expansion of the university district urban center. It has urban center goals for promoting dense mixed use walkable communities. And it has in close proximity to frequent transit. And actually, depending on how far you like to walk, it&#39;s walkable to the. Soon to open sound transit station. It does. The zoning is LR three. There is no M suffix. And it does not have an M suffix. It does not have an M suffix. It does not have an M suffix. It does not have an M suffix. The next slide is. A future land use. Map amendment for the hundredth street station area. It&#39;s approximately 8.4 acres of land directly across the street from the station. Early implementation action of a broader station wide station area planning process underway. It&#39;s informed by the community&#39;s vision for the future of the area. As captured in the draft plan that we released in March. It demonstrates an early commitment by the city to transit oriented development. Yeah. Of the 2025 opening at the station. And so, you know, we&#39;ve had a lot of work to do over the last year and a half and a half, and we&#39;ve made a lot of changes to the development. We&#39;ve made a lot of changes. So, and as you see in this slide, The gray areas, the station area that we&#39;ve been focusing on, but the, the planning effort actually covers this broader yellow area. And that process should be complete in the next. Year To Two years. We had planned to introduce some amendments related to the industrial maritime strategy. Those will wait until next year. We are currently in the middle of an EIS, and there will be a set of proposed land use policy amendments for industrial land. At that time when we&#39;re complete with that EIS is complete. Changes will include a new industrial land use framework based on the three new zoning concepts. We&#39;ll have a new land use framework, which will include a plan to provide a better transition in industrial areas. There will be a plan to incorporate maritime manufacturing and logistics, which is kind of the core industrial zone. Industry and innovation to encourage employment density around future transit stations. And urban industrial to provide a better transition between core industrial areas and non-industrial areas. There would be a Paul recommendation for a policy that limits future amendments that change the boundaries of a mic. The city&#39;s intent to partner with the state of Washington on a master planning process. For any future redevelopment of the inter-bay armory. Or the Waska site. Jim, can you confirm that since we&#39;re unable to move this section forward. At this time due to the SEPA process and issues. Can you confirm? We will be bringing an amendment forward on Friday to remove the section. Of. Of this ordinance. That is my understanding. Substance disorders. Industrial. Okay. Thank you. Our final slide. Our other docketed proposals. We have a proposal to look at some earlier proposed amendments relating to. Relating to tree protection and canopy, as well as perhaps casting a broader look and working with urban forestry commission. And the city of Washington. Is being deferred to the major update. Fossil fuels and. Human health is also being deferred. To the major 2024 major update. Evaluating the appropriateness of the South park urban village designation will also be considered in the major update. And then. And then. The support transportation impact fees is also an item. That the council is pursuing. And that concludes our presentation. Thanks, Jim. I&#39;ve got one question about a one 30th. We could slide back to that slide. I got to go back in my neighborhood council member. Cause I&#39;m so excited about it. Yeah. I am. If you&#39;re not, I was just, I was mostly interested in the timeline. There is an interesting. On the map. It demonstrates the need for a lid in that area, just by the street. The street grade. I was just going to point it out, but if you&#39;re not able to cycle back, it&#39;s totally okay. Isn&#39;t that slide six. It is. Yeah. It&#39;s okay. Jim, do you have a timeline on, on that? That work is underway. Patrice, can you speak to the timeline on the broader effort? Yeah, this is Patrice Carol. I&#39;ve been working on this project. So we&#39;re right now we&#39;re looking at two timelines. One would. Be completed by 2022. Or the other. To be completed in 2023. I&#39;m sorry. The other would be to align it with the comprehensive plan, major update. And that would. The action would be completed by 2024. Great. Thank you. Just in that area, if you&#39;re, if anyone&#39;s ever looking at a map, you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s a intersection there. And that intersection is a diagonal to that intersection. Of. 1 30th. It&#39;s interesting to see how the freeway has disconnected the neighborhood. In that real physical way that we can no longer use Roosevelt way as it was once connected. This is just one example of many about why we need to reconnect our neighborhoods by living. Okay. Thank you. Any council member Peterson, take it away. Thank you, chair Strauss. I wanted to address one of the items in my district district four. If we&#39;re able to go back to that slide showing the. That half block. I want to thank the office of planning and community development for reaching out to my office, but I also want to thank the city of Davis for their support of this project. I did raise concerns about it. And so I want to explain briefly why I will be supporting. This particular up zone. This area is just 25% of the whole block. It&#39;s already multifamily housing. It&#39;s attached to the existing boundary of the urban center. It&#39;s at the intersection of two arterials. And. It&#39;s not just one of the areas. It&#39;s a, it&#39;s a big part of the neighborhood. So the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the. Fourth and fifth street hall. We&#39;ll have another crack at reviewing what, what happened? What happens ultimately. On these parcels. I just wanted to explain my vote in support of this. Thank you. Thank you. Council member Peterson. Colleagues, any other questions? Council member Lewis, any questions. Council member. Just quickly. I just wanted to say, I sit on sound transit. And for us to get the one 30th street light rail back on the board again. This has been good on since 2016. We&#39;re back in the game again. But one of the things that your office was so great about turning everything around is for me to get the material that you&#39;ve been talking about. And so we are, we are. We are working on the, the third and 30th infill station here. So we can continue with this incredible rich transit spine for three counties, but more importantly, we focus on holler lake and bitter lake and North gate and the North side. In conjunction that it get built with Linwood link. Cause it makes no sense to build a ghost station and then wait 10 years and not finish it. So you guys were instrumental. You all came through when we asked you to. And so I&#39;m just so grateful for you guys. And I want to say a big thank you to you, because you were just, you&#39;ve been up there and. I know we&#39;ve been dealing and working on this since the day I got elected and certainly was an issue that I was working on back in 2015. And to all those community groups up North, particularly rate, Renee Stanton and a lot of those folks. We have just a great community up there. That&#39;s been really involved and we&#39;ll continue to be involved, but I can&#39;t. Thank you. Thank you for your hard work. Sometimes I know I&#39;ve been a pest. So thank you so much. And Lish. And Eric, thank you again for the information that you provided as usual, excellent analysis. And I appreciate that. Very well said council member Juarez. And with the slide on the screen. Now you can see how Roosevelt way is disconnected by I five, but you can also see how it&#39;s disconnected by five. So thank you for that. And with that, I heard council member Lewis does not have any questions at this time. Seeing no further questions. I will open. The public hearing unless Lish Eric. Michael or Jim, you have a dish seeing knows we will now move on to the public hearing. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Patrice. Amazing work. Before we open the remote public hearing. I would like to remind everyone that the public hearing is open to all members of the public. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us and we will be happy to answer them. We are continuously looking for ways. To fine tune this process and adding new features that allow for additional means of public participation in our council meetings. I&#39;ll moderate the public hearing in the following manner. Each speaker will be given two minutes to speak out. One speaker at a time. And in the order in which you registered on the council&#39;s website, if you have not yet registered to speak and would like to, please do so now. The public hearing is open to all members of the public. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us. The link is also listed on today&#39;s agenda. Once I call the speaker&#39;s name. Staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and automatic prompt of you have been unmuted will be the speaker&#39;s cue that it is their turn to speak. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item in which you are addressing as a reminder. Public comment needs to relate to council bill one, two zero one five four for this public hearing. If you are not on today&#39;s agenda, you can provide written comments by emailing my office or sign up for the appropriate public hearing. Speakers will hear a chime in 10 seconds of the. Our left of the allotted time. Once you hear the chime, we ask you begin to wrap up your public comment. If speakers do not end their public comments at the end of the allotted time provided the speaker&#39;s microphone will be muted to allow us to calm the next speaker. Once you&#39;ve completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line. And if you plan to continue following this meeting, please do so via Seattle channel or the listening options listed on the agenda. The public hearing on council bill one, two zero one five four is now open. And we will begin with the first speaker on the list. I see two speakers. Signed up. One is not present. Katie Kendall, you are not present. So please do call in. It is not a listen line. It is. I see two speakers. Signed up. Please read the. The line that you receive and. Maybe it, if you can confirm. When they sign up, they receive an email. Is that correct? Affirmative. So if you have signed up, please read the email in which you have response received. The two speakers are David morning and Katie Kendall, David. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you. I&#39;d like to just make a small pitch for the com plan. To consider the city&#39;s goal to achieve. The 30%. Tree canopy cover. By the year 2037. And just be more definitive in terms of how we&#39;ll reach that goal. As you know, The tree canopy cover. Accommodates. Less than one quarter of the tree canopy. And if we rely on that. We will be. For a challenge to achieve. Can be goal. We believe that you can have both density. And. So. Consider in your decisions or anything you can. To improve the tree canopy. Thank you very much. Thank you, David. Up next. We do have Katie Kendall who I see is present. Good morning, Katie. Maybe I see you are off mute on our end. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m on mute. Thank you. Technological technological difficulties on my end, but thank you very much. Good morning. Good morning. Okay. Sorry, we just got that time started a little early. We&#39;ll reset it for you there. Take it away, Katie. Good morning. Great. Good morning, council members. My name is Katie Kendall and I&#39;m commenting today on behalf of the city council. The city council has adopted a motion to amend. 5, 6, 1, 5, 15th. Avenue Northeast, along with the other seven lots on the east side of that block. To be included. In the university community urban center. And this is the first amendment. So 1, 2 0 1 5 4. As outlined in more detail in the director&#39;s report and in the presentation today. This amendment meets many existing comprehensive plan goals, including establishing. A multi-family housing that is currently provided on this block. In fact, some of the existing buildings on this block are already larger than the existing zoning is currently. The updated designation would serve the purpose of increased housing supply, pedestrian friendly density and transit accessible development. Goals that are featured prominently in the Seattle comprehensive plan, the countywide planning policies and vision 2040. We ask you that. Ask that you amend the flume to expand the urban center boundary and change the designation from multifamily residential to urban center. Thank you for your consideration today. Oh, thank you. Katie. I T can you confirm there are no additional public comment registrants for. This bill. There are no more public hearing registrants for CB 1, 2 0 1 5 4. Thank you. Seeing as that was our last speaker remotely present to speak at this public hearing, the public hearing on council bill. 1, 2 0 1 5 4 is now closed. Thank you to everyone who provided comment today. Thank you. And I&#39;m happy to be back before the committee this Friday afternoon for a possible vote. We will move on to item three on the agenda. Next is council bill 1, 2 0 1 5 5. Which will amend the comprehensive plan to. Change the name of single family areas to neighborhood residential areas. Mr. Thank you. This is part two of our annual comprehensive plan amendment. After appearing on the comprehensive plan docket in 2019, 2020. And 2021. Council is moving this forward as an amendment this year. We&#39;ve chosen to consider this as a separate led as separate legislation from the other amendments to reflect. That council is leading this amendment. And that to keep this discussion separate from the more complex. This name change was recommended to us by the Seattle planning commission and it reflects the reality on the ground today. What are known as single family zones already include much more than just single family homes. They include households with multiple families, as well as legacy duplexes row houses and apartment buildings. Built before the current. Zoning rules applied. I&#39;ve been happy to co-sponsor this legislation with council member Mosqueda. Who&#39;s been working towards. Since at least 2019. We have with us today. Lish Witson of council central staff to walk us through the amendment wish. Would you like to take us away? Great. Thank you. So this set of amendments. Of course, this is a separate legislation from the other amendments to reflect the reality on the ground today. That council is leading this amendment. It&#39;s a separate legislation from the other amendments to reflect the reality on the ground today. We have with us today. Lish Witson of council central staff to walk us through the amendment wish. Would you like to take us away? Thank you. So this set of amendments. Is very simple, but it touches a large number of policies and goals through and discussion sections. In the conference of plan. It amends the land use element, housing element, parks and open space element. 17 neighborhood plans. The housing appendix and the future land use map to change the name of single family areas. To neighborhood residential areas. There&#39;s no substantive effect from the bill, but the intent is to better reflect the mix of character. And activities that are currently found in what are called single family areas. By including a more inclusive name. You had a public hearing on this. To get initial feedback from the community at the end of July. Today is the official public hearing on the bill. After the original public hearing, we did hear from one. Neighborhood, the Morgan community association. That has requested an amendment that&#39;s attached to the. Agenda. And that would affect the Morgan junction neighborhood plan and the North gate. Neighborhood plan. And with that, I will. Be available for any questions. Thanks. I have a few. And then colleagues, if you have questions. We&#39;ll take that. I&#39;m going to ask these questions to lift up what you&#39;ve already said. Can you confirm that this amendment does not change city policy on what is allowed within these zones? Correct. Correct. And can you confirm that the amendment listed on the agenda improves the readability of some neighborhoods? Correct. And can you confirm that the amendment listed on the agenda improves the readability of some neighborhood plans and, again, does not make any substantive changes? Is that correct? Correct. Great. And can you confirm that the amendment listed on the agenda improves the readability of some neighborhood plans and, again, does not make any substantive changes? Correct. And can you confirm that if this amendment passes, this council may want to take up future legislation to amend the land use code to reflect the name change there as well? Can you also confirm that understanding that the changes would only be to the name and again, not to zoning policy? Correct. And can you confirm that this amendment would be changed to reflect the name of the neighborhood? Correct.
And can you confirm that the amendment would be changed to reflect the name of the neighborhood? Correct. And can you confirm that under the zoning policy, this council is able to amend the land use code, making the same changes throughout the land use code, but not change any policy or regulation. Okay, great. So this is, again, changing the name to reflect the reality that we have legacy duplexes, only to reflect the neighborhoods that we live in. Colleagues, are there any questions on this bill? I am not seeing. I see council member Peterson. Please take it away. Thank you, chair Strauss. I don&#39;t have any questions, but I do have some comments because I received some letters and emails from community leaders in the district who had concerns about this. And I wanted to explain why I&#39;m likely to support this. So I don&#39;t have the questions. Should I save those until Friday? No, please. I mean, either or your preference. Okay. Thank you. So, you know, I really appreciate what our central staff analyst said. And then what the chair lifted up is that this is, this is a name change for what is already. I mean, this is a name change for what is already happening in the geographic areas. And I think the real discussion would be happening. The substantive discussion would be happening at a later time. You know, there will probably be a robust discussion about certain changes in the future for zoning. I think what matters to me most in that discussion, is that there&#39;s a clear and immediate public benefit, such as onsite, very low income housing. That&#39;s built. When there&#39;s additional density. It&#39;s ideally near frequent transit and where there&#39;s sufficient infrastructure, such as school capacity. And that we put mitigations in place before the actual substantive up zones occur. Such as making sure we don&#39;t demolish. And, you know, we were mindful of the existing nationally occurring affordable housing. We were mindful of the tree canopy and our desire to preserve that and grow that. I think we, we, I&#39;m hoping we learned a lot from the mandatory housing affordability program, which had. A good intention, some, some benefits, but also in my opinion, some shortcomings. And I think that&#39;s, that&#39;s, that&#39;s, that&#39;s, that&#39;s something that we need to, that we need to be able to address in the future. And I think that&#39;s something that we need to be mindful of. And I think that&#39;s one of the concerns that, you know, I&#39;m mindful of those concerns and that discussion will be taking place at a later time. And that this name change is, is not as our central staff analyst said, it&#39;s not substantive at this time. So thank you, chair. Thank you. Council member Peterson. Any other questions? Council member Lewis here. Council member Lewis. Yeah. I just want to briefly address this legislation too. I will be voting in favor of it today. Similar to council member Peterson. I have heard. A number of potential concerns about the impact of this name change. And, you know, I guess I just want to speak generally. As someone who represents a district that. That includes some of our most residentially dense districts in the city and Belltown Southlake union, Pioneer square. Downtown, but then also represent some of the least. Housing. Neighborhoods. Magnolia and Queen Anne. That. You know, that there, there are, when you take a walk, You know, there are a significant amount of really attractive multifamily residences, be they condos, be they apartments. That exists in, in parts of the neighborhood that. That do not feel reflective. And I&#39;ve talked to people who live in some of those. Housing placements. About. You know, How that fits into the definition of single family neighborhood and that it&#39;s confusing to have. You know, four plexes triplexes. In some cases. In the middle of residential neighborhoods, the, the, the ghost of. Old corner stores with. Two stories on top of them that are now all housing. And. And that, that, that is a place where a lot of the residential communities do flourish and used to serve that surrounding neighborhood. And I really do think that at, at the bare minimum, this really is just a conversation of recognizing what already exists. On Monday, we got the initial ADU reports from SBC. Indicating. In really attractive map form. Of new accessory dwelling units and detached accessory dwelling units. In a lot of these neighborhoods currently zoned a single family. And I really do think that moving forward, we should just accept. What is true here in the identity of these neighborhoods and embrace it, that there is. An increasing amount of urban and residential density. And that everybody feel included in that definition of these neighborhoods. Certainly as we move forward. You know, I am. I&#39;m certainly looking forward to discussions. Where there can be an increased amount of dynamism and an increased amount of planning around 15 minute communities. That&#39;s that is, I believe a separate conversation from this name change. And, you know, I don&#39;t say that to devalue the name change, but I do say that to indicate that our work isn&#39;t done. And that this is queuing up a bigger and broader conversation that we can have as a community to, to fully. Make all the neighborhoods in the city dynamic, diverse and interesting places to live. And with that, mr. Chair, appreciate your leadership on moving this forward and I&#39;m certainly prepared to, to vote. At the chair&#39;s pleasure on this. So thank you. Thank you. Council member Lewis. Council member war is anything on this bill. Totally. Okay. If not. Yeah, I&#39;m good. We&#39;re good. We&#39;re cool. All right. And I won&#39;t make any further comments because you can see that I support it by being a co-sponsor. Before, so we&#39;re going to move into. So again, we previously held a public hearing on this proposal on July 28th to get feedback prior to introducing legislation. And then we had a public hearing on July 30th. And then we had a public hearing on July 30th. Friday with the amendment regarding. Clarifying language of. Of names. So that&#39;s the process. We&#39;re going to now move into the public hearing before we open the remote public hearing. I would again, ask that everyone please be patient as we continue to learn to operate this new system in real time and navigate through the inevitable growing pains. We are continuously looking for ways to fine tune this process. So with that, I would like to invite the public hearing in the following manner. Each speaker will be given two minutes to speak. I&#39;ll call on one speaker at a time and in the order in which they registered on the council&#39;s website. If you have not yet registered to speak and would like to, you can sign up for the end of this public hearing by going to the council&#39;s website. That&#39;s Seattle.gov forward slash council. The link is also listed on today&#39;s agenda. Once I call on a speaker&#39;s name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone with an automatic prompt that you&#39;ve been unmuted. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item in which you are addressing. Again, as a reminder, this is the public hearing on council bill one, two zero one five five. If you have comments about something that is not the. Not this council bill or not on today&#39;s agenda. You can always provide written comments by emailing my office or signing up for the appropriate public hearing. Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of the allotted time. Once you hear the chime, we ask that you begin to wrap up your public comment. If speakers do not end their, their comments at the end of the allotted time provided the speaker&#39;s microphone will be muted. To allow us to move on to call on the next speaker. Once you&#39;ve completed your public comment, we ask that you please disconnect from the line. And if you plan to continue following this meeting, please do so via the Seattle channel or the listening options. Listen on the agenda. The public hearing on council bill one, two zero one five five is now open. And we will begin with the first speaker on the list. I am only seeing. Ah, now there we go. I&#39;m seeing many people on this list. Currently not present are Judy Bindage. Laura Lowe, David Ward. And Evan Shaw. I will call a number of names so that you know where you are. I&#39;ll run through the list now. So, you know, where you are on the list. We have Matt Hutchins followed by Brady Nordstrom followed by David Moring. Susan grant. Ryan Donahue. Vanessa Murdoch. Jay. Katzenberger. Judy Bindage. Bonnie Williams. Irene wall. Laura Lowe. Alicia Ruiz. Colleen McClure. David Ward. Logan Bowers. Evan Shaw. Again, Judy. Laura. David Evan, you are not present at this time. We will begin with Matt followed by Brady Nordstrom and then David morning. Matt Hutchins. Good morning. How are you today? Good. Good. How are you all doing? Oh, wow. Let&#39;s see. My name is Matt Hutchins. I&#39;m an architect. And I represent a Seattle. I am speaking in favor of switching just two words. You know, neighborhood residential for single family. And thus making space in the code. Code language to be a little bit more inclusive and flexible. We currently have a land use code that is stuck in the past. We have a neighborhood character code. That preferences, a car dependent land use or venues pattern. Codeifies exclusion and views new housing or diverse housing types. Corner stores, mixed uses. As an assault by neighborhood character, rather than part of the very backbone. What makes our neighborhood special. And when we, when we think about preserving neighborhood character, as opposed to embracing. The, the challenge that we have in front of us. We have to think about how we&#39;re going to do that. And how we&#39;re going to prevent terrible outcomes. So if we can&#39;t switch out these just two words, how are we going to do the much harder work? But preparing for all the people that are going to be coming to living. Are coming to live here. And we can&#39;t change that. These two words, how are we going to do the much harder work? Fighting climate change. And finally, you know, if we can&#39;t change out these two words, How are we going to address. These past inequalities. And build more diverse welcoming neighborhoods in the future. Thank you, Matt. Up next is Brady Nordstrom followed by David mooring and then Suzanne grant. Good morning, Brady. Hello. Greetings. So my name is Brady Nordstrom and I&#39;m here today on behalf of the Seattle for everyone coalition. Seattle for everyone strongly supports council bill. 12 0 1 55 that amends the comprehensive plan to rename single family areas as neighborhood residential areas. We are a broad coalition of nonprofit, affordable housing developers and providers, private developers, labor business, environmentalists. Social justice advocates and neighbors. And what brings us together is the belief that everyone in our city should have access to a safe, stable, and affordable home. And land use is the foundation to accomplishing this goal. We believe it is important to decouple this designation from. The past so that we can better assess and address our present and future needs and challenges. So. First of all, single family zoning is inaccurate. As many have noted. I&#39;m considering the diverse uses and household structures that have evolved in these zones. So I&#39;m not going to go into depth on that, but I think we shouldn&#39;t erase these aspects of our city that in the past were important and continue to be important. And I think it&#39;s important to recognize that. And I think it&#39;s important to recognize that. Secondly, single family zoning has an exclusionary path that doesn&#39;t reflect our values as a city. And this is a path that&#39;s done harm that we can see through the racial homeownership gap, divestment in historical communities of color and the affordability crisis. And there&#39;s bountiful research linking single family zoning to these impacts around the country. And not just in Seattle. I think it&#39;s important to recognize that. And I think it&#39;s important to recognize that. And I think it&#39;s important to recognize that. And I think it&#39;s important to recognize that. This will enable us to have a balanced assessment and discussion about our needs in the future. Thank you very much. Thank you, Brady. Up next. We have David mooring followed by Suzanne grant and then Ryan Donahue. Good morning, David. Great to hear you again. There you are. Okay. Hi, this is a David. I&#39;m fine. From the perspective of a multifamily homeowner in the interbay Magnolia. The neighborhood of our current city. I agree the word family within zoning land use is considered by some as exclusionary. As individuals and roommates can live in a house together without having to live in the same neighborhood. I have two questions about the council bill. That required me. Correct. One. I live in a multifamily zone. In a townhouse, as I said. And I consider my area as a neighborhood. So. Why does this council bill exclude multifamily as being part of the neighborhood? Two. Why is the term multifamily? Not also considered exclusionary. As single family is. If there are changes to zoning terms. I&#39;m sorry. To offend all. This oversight may be resolved by learning from the Tacoma. Who is looking to remain there. I said in our zones. Low density and middle density. Lastly. And probably more importantly. Why are there at least two whereas statements. Regarding expanding housing types and broader range of uses. Within this council bill. It is simply just a name change. So. Please remove all unrelated. Whereas statements as you&#39;re confusing. A lot of people with us. Look at these. Whereas statements. We are at the asset. Each city council member. I&#39;ll see the clear. Your individual plans. For the city. In lieu of. Seattle residents for what they might desire. For. Sales residential choices. The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the potential zones. Should be eliminated. Thank you very much. Be consistent with a term family. The honest and intent of the. So let me make low density property and three. Bring broad impact choices to our public. Thank you so much, David. Always great to hear you. Good morning. Good morning. This is Suzanne grant talking about TV one 2155. I assume you can hear me, right? Yeah. Good morning. Okay. With the climate catastrophe that we are facing. Everyone is talking about the extreme importance of trees, except Seattle city council. In this bill, there&#39;s a lot of language about allowing development in neighborhood residential areas. But what is missing is any language that will protect the trees that currently exist. In the single family neighborhoods in yards. You all know that 70% of Seattle tree canopy is currently in single family neighborhoods. But if Seattle city council enables FTCI to allow more structures to be built in those neighborhoods, without a mandate. That existing mature trees in the yard. The trees will be renewed, removed, make the building easier. More density is possible and desirable. But development needs to be creative and the responsibility is on Seattle city council to require FTCI to retain what is left of our urban forest. I disagree with the statement made today that quote, there&#39;s no substantive effect from the bill. A name change can have great effect. Why change it? If it doesn&#39;t. The next change will be a change in zoning and more building will become easier with less restrictions and oversight. I don&#39;t feel that we should just quote, accept it. As CM Lewis stated today, please, please insert appropriate language to save trees and amend this legislation before passing it as it is currently written. Now, if I still have time at the beginning of the meeting, you always promised to steward our land. Why do you not follow through with this promise and pass a stronger tree ordinance? Your words become insincere at best with this egregious submission, your assistance that the tree ordinance languishes in the mayor&#39;s office is an excuse. I hope to hear on Friday that FTCI has agreed to pass the ordinance or that Seattle city council will place a moratorium on cutting exceptional trees until it does. Thank you. Thank you, Suzanne. Always great to hear from you. Up next. We have Ryan Donahue followed by Vanessa Murdoch and then J Katzenberger. Noting. Or Laura Lowe, David Ward. You are still not present. Good morning, Ryan. Good morning. Thank you. Chair Strauss and member of the land use and neighborhoods committee for the record. My name is Ryan Donahue and I&#39;m the advocacy and policy director for Habitat for Humanity, Seattle King and Kittitas counties. We&#39;ve been proud to be able to provide homeownership opportunities for low-income families for 35 years here in the Seattle metro area. I&#39;m here today to strongly urge you to vote in favor of amending the comprehensive plan to change the name of single family areas to neighborhood residential areas. While this proposed name change in and of itself won&#39;t undo past harms or directly create a more welcoming and inclusive future for housing in Seattle, this change is a key step in assessing your contemporary land use needs and practices with fresh eyes. Single family zoning, which was implemented in 1923 has a history of racial and economic exclusion through racially restrictive covenants and discriminatory redlining. The effects of those are still felt today. This name change can help facilitate a more balanced and substantial discussion during the upcoming major comprehensive plan process. As we consider updating our zoning to better address the challenges we are actively confronting like racial injustice, climate change, rising housing costs, economic exclusion, and community displacement. As things stand now of the 273 homes we have in our pipeline, more than 65% of them are fall within the city of Seattle. That is due in large part to the efforts of the Seattle office of housing, the Seattle housing levy, and the efforts that you all have made on committees and in council like this to allow for things like more density and encouraging permanently affordable home ownership. One example of the kind of change that we could see even more of by passing this proposal is actually our work in the South park neighborhood on October 2nd. We&#39;re actually celebrating the completion of our most recent development. Thanks to zoning flexibility. We were able to turn a single family home into 13 permanently portable homes. I would encourage you to reach out to me at Ryan dot Donahue at habitat. That&#39;s kc.org. And we&#39;d be happy to pass along an invitation. Thank you so much for your time. And we. Thank you, Ryan. And thank you for building the family housing that our city desperately needs. Thank you. Thank you. Up next is Vanessa Murdoch followed by Jay Katzenberger and then Judy Bendish. Good morning, Vanessa. Good morning, chair Strauss and members of the land use and neighborhoods committee. My name is Vanessa Murdoch. I&#39;m the executive director of the Seattle planning commission and I&#39;m offering comments this morning on their behalf. The commission appreciates the opportunity to support council bill 13, which is a comprehensive plan amendment process. This change will provide these areas of the more accurate title that better reflects the diversity of households now living within them. And we&#39;ll provide an important first step. Toward making these areas more equitable and accessible. The planning commission&#39;s 2018 neighborhoods for all report advised making this change. This correction to the zoning term will address what is currently in this characterization. Of both the housing available in these areas, as well as the people living there. Indeed the term single family areas has been a misnomer for many years, but especially since 1994. When accessory dwelling or mother in. Law type units for were first approved in these locations. The commission supports the term neighborhood residential as the more accurate description. Of the housing types currently available in these areas. And hope this name change will help pave the way for encouraging more equitable access to a diversity of housing types. Along with parks, schools, services, and transit for all. The commission is committed to making sure that housing types are accessible. Throughout Seattle&#39;s residential neighborhoods. This name change is a modest, but important step that accurately frames neighborhood residential areas. That&#39;s having a variety of building types. Welcoming a diversity of residents with a broad range of household configuration. The commission supports this comp plan amendment and thanks council members for their work on this important issue. Thank you, Vanessa. Next we have Jay Katzenberger followed by Judy. And then Bonnie Williams on deck. Good morning, Jay. Hi, I&#39;m Jay Katzenberger. And regarding the name change from single family to neighborhood residential. I really applaud the more inclusive term. But I want to see a clear statement. That it does not change the definition or provisions of the current zoning. And that is such changes were to happen. It would have to happen in subsequent legislation. The way the document reads now, it says. It is quote, not intended. To have a substantive effect. On the uses permitted in those areas. I think the ordinance should clearly state that it doesn&#39;t like others. On the council said just a few moments ago. Point to that last. Next to the last, whereas statement. It clearly states that this is a step toward provisions proposed. Proposed in the comprehensive plan. And that&#39;s a substantive change. So I&#39;d like to see that next to the last. Whereas statement struck. For instance. I also want to note that these amendments implied that zoning was put in place to create class boundaries. Rather than to create a gradual change. I would like to. A vote for this name change. If you have to. In order to revise this proposal to include a very clear statement. That zoning requirements and provisions. Like tree protection and open space. Does not change. Because the way it&#39;s currently. Worded. It is not simply a name change. And I think that&#39;s wrong. Also, regardless of what happens on the sports training facility bill. Go storm. Thank you, Jay. Good suggestions. Up next. We have Judy Bindage by Bonnie Williams and then Irene wall. Judy. Good morning. Good morning. Can you hear me? Okay. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Chairperson Strouse. And thank you for asking. Mr. Those questions. That this. Not simply. Echoing the previous speaker. That this is simply not. Intended to, but actually is no change. And I actually appreciated the previous speaker saying that. It is not simply a name change. It is no change because my neighborhood has always had. Which is. Which is. One house. On one lot. Has always had mixed use. With. Multi. Generational families. With subdivisions of a part into apartments in the house. So we&#39;ve had at least 20% of my neighborhood, Has that kind of figuration. Already. But what bothers me so much. And this is where. This is where I really part ways. With the discussion. Is what council member must get a previously said. And I&#39;ve quoted that in my letters to the council. And to you. And she said. I will be working on legislation to start the process, to repeal the apartment bands. By converting the current SFZ. To residential zoning. So she has made her intent. Absolutely clear. Absolutely clear. And that&#39;s not the way to do it. And unless she repudiates what she said to say that this actually. Has no change. By adopting this language. Then I think that the whole thing should be shoved. Thank you. And I have in my letter outlined what really needs to take place. And that is concrete planning. To make sure that every neighborhood has affordable housing. And plans to absolutely. I completely agree with Susan grant. Thank you, Judy. And please. Thank you for sending in your letters and feel free to send in any further comments. Okay. Next we have Bonnie Williams followed by Irene wall. And then Laura low Lori, you&#39;re not present. David ward also not present. So I&#39;m going to run through the next. I&#39;m going to run through the remainder of the speakers, just so everyone knows where they are. We have Bonnie Williams, Irene wall, Laura low, Alicia Ruiz, David ward. And then we have. I&#39;m going to use M key. Ruby Holland. Ruby, David, Laura are not present at this time. Please refer to the email you&#39;ve received. It is not the call in line. It&#39;s not the listen line on the agenda. Bonnie. Good morning. You&#39;re up. I hope you&#39;re having a great day. I see you there. Press star six. Hello. Good morning. We can hear you. Good morning. Okay. Good morning. With all the discussion so far. I&#39;m not convinced that this is just a technical change and part of the contradictions that I&#39;ve been. Seeing and dealing with is mosquitoes comments and the urbanist about how she would proceed. If this. Warrant is to be held. In the five year plan. For 2025, the name change and the amendments that are included in the, especially in the land use section. I think that this should be held until the major update for the 2020 form. Com plan update with a more thorough process. And then the next step is to introduce. Future rezones and new highs housing types. I think this. Has not had enough circulation to neighborhoods. I think they&#39;ve been skipped over. I would request. That residential and commercial zones need clear distinctions. In this bill. So therefore remove land use. 7.11, which talks about. The zoning change. And giving the council authority to pass. That kind of. Zoning change. So that language is ambiguous. It&#39;s open for interpretation. It&#39;s not clear. It&#39;s not transparent. I feel there are top-down decisions to the neighborhood plans without extensive outreach. Okay. Thank you. In 2019 single family. Oh, Thank you. Thank you, Bonnie. Appreciate it. And feel free to write. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Can I make one quick comment? One quick one. Yeah, you stopped at 10 seconds. So. Okay. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye. Up next is Irene wall. Followed by Laura low, Laura, you are not present. If Laura does not become present, we will do Irene and then Alicia. So we have Irene, Laura low, Alicia Ruiz, Colleen McClure. Good morning, Irene. Good morning. Can you hear me? We can. Irene wall. Hello. Hello, everyone. I am a member of the S F community council. And I am here to report. Merely relabeling the S S zone land and policy documents does nothing except to create further confusion. Since there is no definition of a quote neighborhood residential zone. In the land use code or any development standards. And it is not typical to name a zone after historical nonconforming uses. We are considering more density in single family zones in the ongoing comp plan update. Also the tree protections being considered in the update are intimately connected to single family zoning. Since most trees are in single family zones. Changing the land use patterns affecting thousands of property owners requires a transparent process. And solid analysis of the details. So wait until the comp plan update. And the accompanying EIS is available. And then decide what should be allowed in single family zones and then rename it accordingly. The proposed neighborhood residential label does not distinguish. The single family zone uses from other primarily residential zones in the same neighborhoods. This further adds to confusion. Merely renaming the zone does nothing to reduce the cost of housing in Seattle or resolve the homeless crisis. It does nothing to stop displacement. The council should allow the comp plan process to proceed and then take the actions to make any zoning changes to accomplish the stated goals. The zone name will be justified at that point. Not now. Thank you, Irene. Laura low is next, but not present. So Laura, if you are listening, please do call back in. Next we have Alicia Ruiz followed by calling the clear David ward. Good morning, Alicia. Good morning. Good morning, council members. My name is Alicia Ruiz. And I&#39;m here today to. Express that master builders association of King and Snohomish County. Fully supports the proposed comprehensive plan amendment. Just changes the name of the single family zone to a more inclusive name. Of neighborhood residential zone. It is an important move forward to support more diverse and equitable neighborhoods. Excuse me. And also adds the opportunity. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll end there. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll end there. Thank you. Thank you, Alicia. Up next is calling the clear. Followed by Logan Bowers. Evan shot Steve&#39;s empty. Laura low, David ward, Ruby Holland. Please call in. If you&#39;d like to testify. Good morning, Colleen. Good morning. I see you there. Press star six, not pound six star six. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Alicia. Up next is calling the clear. Followed by Logan Bowers. Evan shot Steve&#39;s empty. Laura low, David ward, Ruby Holland. Please call in. If you&#39;d like to testify. Good morning, Colleen. I see you there. Press star six, not pound six star six. There you are. Off mute. Perfect. Good morning.
I can hear your voice. Thank you. This is Colleen McAleer. Representing law first community club. And we&#39;re talking. Today about 12. And it&#39;s the staff report. I&#39;m going to be covering. The new changes to the, to the housing development plan. 1.5. The main change for residential is, is not offensive at all. And it&#39;s actually very inclusive to reflect us. If council has noted. The types of housing diversity that we already have, even in our neighborhood. People would be surprised about that, but there&#39;s plenty of duplexes. They do use there&#39;s apartments on the edges. And it&#39;s all fine. That&#39;s all part of the neighborhood. And it&#39;s all part of the neighborhood. So I&#39;m not going to go into detail on that. I just wanted to make some unrelated statements. And I think you made it very clear that it was just a clean bill, just changing the name. But I think the bill really needs to be scoped through to be sure that we take out anything that&#39;s not related to simple name change. A couple of other things. The legislation should, the goal is to promote more homeownership. And so we&#39;ve got to do that. I think it&#39;s important to say that. The city has to be clear that, that we are a community. We are a community. When you go to the RCLU 7.1 0, it says reflect the character of the existing low density development. The regulation of. The scale, the sighting and structure orientation and setbacks. But who polices that. I think the bigger problem is all of us have seen it. Seattle department of construction and inspections continually gives departures. And we need to police that character. So I think when legislation comes to be with this change. We do really need to put mechanisms there for protecting that character and how it&#39;s going to be done. And then lastly, the tree. Canopy is, as we all know, in this committee, mostly embedded into the single family. Which is the residential areas. And for the last 20 years. The single family has lost about 10% of their canopy, which is a lot of trees. And that&#39;s a lot of trees. And that&#39;s a lot of trees. And that&#39;s a lot of trees. And my family housing. Went from 18% to only 5%. And I think that&#39;s something that we need to embed. Hand in hand with the tree. Protection. Thank you for your. Work on this today. Bye-bye. Thank you, Colleen. Always great to hear from you up next. We have Logan Bowers followed by Evan. And Steve&#39;s empty. That will complete our list unless Laura. David Ward. Ruby Holland. Does call in. Good morning. Thank you council members for your time. My name is Logan Bowers. I am a small business owner. My wife and I own a brick border retail shop in district seven. You&#39;ll hear. You&#39;ve heard from a lot of other public comments. Supporting this legislation on livability and equity grounds. At first, I just want to say I co-signed all of that. Completely agree. I will add my perspective. As a local small business owner. So this is directed at the council members who claim to care about us small businesses. We need this legislation and we need more. We need customers. We need more customers. We need customers who can walk to our businesses. We need customers who can bite to our businesses. We also need employees to be able to afford. To live near work and not commute an hour from outside of the city. This ordinance is a smart first step. Towards supporting us. Placing customers and employees. Near our businesses. So this is a smart first step. Towards supporting us. You care about a small businesses. You&#39;ll support this ordinance. And you will support. Future additions to the housing stock at all income level. Thank you very much. Thank you. Council member chair Strauss for all your hard work. Thank you, Logan. Always nice to hear your voice. Up next, Evan shop followed by Steve&#39;s empty. Hello. Excuse me. Evan Shaw. First time I&#39;ve commented on. Meeting like this. I will say someone who&#39;s working, you know, I had to wait a while to get on here, but, you know, appreciate. Chance to be able to talk. I agree with. People who have talked about making. More human focused neighborhoods in Seattle, but I think it&#39;s important to talk about. The racial history of this. Specific type of zoning. Designation and how changing that name is. You know, a step. Towards, you know, perhaps getting back to a better, a better place there. And then on climate change, obviously, you know, Sprawl. Commuting all that&#39;s very bad for that. We&#39;ve got to do more infill development. I appreciate the folks who are talking about trees. And, you know, I think it&#39;s important for us to be able to. Help out in the net on the climate change situation. If we&#39;re bulldozing acres. To build new suburbs. So I&#39;d love to see the trees protected here, but how to think globally. When we&#39;re talking about climate change. So. All those reasons I support. The main change. Thank you. Thank you, Evan. Okay. We have a second to last call for Laura Lowe, David Ward and Ruby Holland. For those three that are not present, please make sure that you have received and are calling in via the email call in line, not the listen line on the agenda. Take it away. Mr. Good morning to you. Yeah. Steve&#39;s I&#39;m key with three pack. Okay. I think it&#39;s important to note that you. Specifically mentioned. The tree protection ordinance, which. Has languages, single family. And if you&#39;re going to. Not change that, but change other things. I think you really need to look and see. If there are other places that you&#39;re missing where a single family language is. Because that will create great confusion. And it means that. You know, we&#39;re not fooling anybody just by changing the name because it&#39;s going to create a lot of confusion. The other point coming up here is that. You know, we&#39;re not fooling anybody. I mean, what you are looking at doing is looking at more density in the city. Three pack is not opposed to that. We support. You know, more affordable housing in the city. We also support the need for. Maintaining trees and increasing our tree canopy up to the level that we. Proposed. So, you know, we&#39;re not fooling anybody. The other part of that depends on, we need a real thorough discussion on how do we do that? And part of the problem is that. We&#39;ve gone 12 years now without updating the tree ordinance, looking at things that could be done. To protect more trees, which. Despite our opposition with the last person said trees create healthy communities and we live in Seattle. We want to keep Seattle healthy. So, you know, we&#39;re not fooling anybody. We support the need to protect the trees in your city. As we see in the South end. We need to correct that. Tree pack with Northwest progressive Institute recently did a poll. That came out and you&#39;ve probably seen that. 70 to 80% of the people that were polled voters that were polled. Support stronger tree protection, including things like maximizing. The retention of existing trees throughout the whole development process. So, you know, we need a thorough discussion on that. Moving forward. We need a thorough discussion of all of our options. Of housing in the city and how we can maximize trees at the same time. Thank you. Thank you. I always great to hear from you, Steve. Thank you for calling in today. I T can you confirm Laura Lowe, David Ward and Ruby Holland are not present. Okay. Excellent. Thank you, son. That was our last speaker remotely present to speak at this public hearing the public hearing on council bill. One 2 0 1 5 5 is now closed. Thank you to everyone who provided comments today. This legislation will be back before committee on Friday afternoon for possible vote. The next item of business is a briefing on council bill 1, 2, 0, 1, 5, 3. The belltown small lots. If my colleagues are. Comfortable after the public hearing, I would like to suspend the rules to have a vote on the same day as the legislation. Received a public hearing because we have had this legislation in our committee before us before. Okay. Thank you. And item for council bill 1, 2, 0, 1, 5, 3. And ordinance relating to land use and zoning. I&#39;m adding a new section to the Seattle municipal code to provide alternate alternative development standards for small lots located in downtown. Thank you. And we received a briefing on this legislation at our August 11th meeting, just before council recess. And I&#39;m going to turn it over to Brennan Lish, Witson of our council central staff. Before you begin, just a reminder. Council member colleagues, I&#39;m going to be asking for a vote after the public hearing. Just as a reminder, Brennan. Lish, can you refresh us on this legislation and provide us a brief overview? Yes. I&#39;ll have a brief PowerPoint to go through. Great. So. This legislation called small lot development in belltown or sometimes belltown innovative construction. Sorry. It&#39;s not going to full screen though, for some reason. Sorry. There we go. Okay. So this legislation is to create more appropriate development standards for small lots in limited areas of belltown in order to create more additional housing. And also to support new types of innovative construction, such as modular and penalized construction that can help to bring down costs and meet environmental goals. So this legislation is to create more appropriate development standards for small lots in limited areas of belltown in order to create more additional housing. And also to support new types of innovative construction, such as modular and penalized construction that can help to bring down costs and meet environmental goals. And also to support new types of innovative construction, such as modular and penalized construction that can help to bring down costs and meet environmental goals. So this is a new type of construction that&#39;s being created in the DMR zones of belltown. On the north side. And that&#39;s for two reasons. One, the height limit of 145 feet already requires steel and concrete construction. The other reason is that these new types of innovative construction, such as panel bias and modular construction. Are allowing. It to become. More easier to build on these kinds of difficult sites that go up to 145 feet. But at the same time, they require a stacking of units. And so that development standard in particular makes them very difficult to build on. So that&#39;s one reason. The DMR zones in belltown that have a height limit of. 145 feet. You can see on the map on the right, it&#39;s those areas shaded in gray. It is 33 blocks. Additionally. Those sites would have to be less than 14,500 square feet. And the building on them would have to be at least 75% residential. And so that&#39;s one reason. The DMR zones in belltown would have to be. Where this that meet that size threshold and could potentially. Have this apply to them and the yellow ones are. Single lots, which are about 6,500 square feet in size. And the blue ones are, are double that size. In terms of what exists on this, There is one that actually is under development. Now that&#39;s the three or three battery sites. Six of them are parking lots and the remainder are a mix of rent. Retail office warehouse. And hotel uses almost all are one story, but some are two stories. The actual change we&#39;re proposing on those sites is simply allowing housing development. To have a slightly different shape and that would be accomplished by two things. One. We would allow the upper stories to be slightly larger. And then we would allow the lower stories to be slightly smaller. And that would basically mean the setback would happen. Closer to the street where it would have more impact visually. I want to highlight here that this would not increase the size of these buildings. It does not change the amount of total floor area. Or the maximum height of these buildings. The idea again, it&#39;s really just have a different shape. But especially for innovative construction. And again, this is a shape that is much more consistent with what we&#39;d see anywhere else in the city. So. I just want to highlight here that this would not increase the size of these buildings. It does not change the amount of total floor area. Or the maximum height of these buildings. The idea again, it&#39;s really just have a different shape. That would make it much easier. To develop for any type of construction. But especially for innovative construction. And, and again, this is a shape that is much more consistent with what we&#39;d see anywhere else in the city. And again, this is a shape that is much more consistent with what we&#39;d see anywhere else in the city. And again, this is a shape that is much more consistent with what we&#39;d see anywhere else. So again, this change would apply to any kind of construction. It would think would be helpful for basically any kind of construction, but especially for the innovative construction approaches that need. That more. Simpler shape to allow stacking of units. And again, property owners could continue to develop under the existing code. That they have today. So it would not. Would not affect anybody who already has planning. And again, this is a shape that would apply to any kind of construction. And again, property owners could continue to develop under the existing code. That they have today. So it would not affect anybody who already has planning. And again, this is a shape that is much more consistent with what we&#39;d see anywhere else in the city. And again, the next slide, just to have an example of what this looks like. The left are the existing rules and the right is the proposed rules. This is probably the most extreme example of a change you might see. It&#39;s on sites that are on the North side of the green streets. And they have a green street setback. And you can see how it simply takes two stair steps. To make it a little bit. Simpler. I also have one example. Which is a much more common one for. The lots that are not on a green street or on the South side of a green street. And you can see today projects are already. Allowed to build kind of as a wall on the street. That wouldn&#39;t change. And so. For these lots, you probably would not notice very much for the street. It&#39;s a little bit smaller. And so under this proposal, the light well would be a little smaller, but it would go down farther to the bottom units as well. So for most sites. Again, this would. Is intending to encourage housing. So we might get housing in places. We wouldn&#39;t get it otherwise. But comparing the existing rules to the. The proposed rules on most sites. It wouldn&#39;t make much difference from the street. So that&#39;s the, my proposal or my presentation. Wonderful last slide. Thank you. I love it. I do have two questions. Just generally does this. And I know you mentioned this. I&#39;m just trying to race to the top. Does this legislation increase the development capacity of these sites in belltown? It does not. It does not change the floor area or the maximum height. Great. And then so. Development capacity remains the same. I, my office has also heard from some property owners in belltown interested in the legislation that apply. To apply to more properties. Running. Can you share why this legislation is just limited to the small lots? Yeah, this is really focused on the small lots because that&#39;s where most of the development is happening. And so we&#39;re focusing on the small lots. We haven&#39;t seen any projects that have been able to develop. Up to that 145 feet on a single lot. We&#39;ve seen. Only one in the last recent history on a double lot. And so these are areas where the, our development standards are really making it very difficult for projects to develop. And so we&#39;re really, we&#39;re focusing on places where the development standards are really preventing housing development. Wonderful. Thank you, Brennan colleagues. Do you have any questions before we move into the public hearing? I know that this is the second time that we have had this bill before us. Council member Lewis. Yes. Thank you. Council member Strauss. And thank you for the presentation and the materials. Sent along in advance here. So am I counting correctly on the map on slide five, that this would only impact about 24 lots. This is presently constituted. In in the area where it would be in effect. That&#39;s right. Obviously lots could in the future be subdivided, but as they exist today, we found 24 lots. That would be that meet the size criteria. All right. And I have a couple of additional questions and. Based on some neighborhood concerns that I&#39;ve heard from residents. Regarding the potential impact. That the difference in shape. Permitted under this ordinance. Would. Allow to make this small lot development feasible in terms of concerns about. The difference between modular and panel buildings. And traditional concrete and steel buildings in terms of the potential shape to maintain. View view corridors or. Access to access to light. Potentially if the, if the buildings are, are sort of bulkier. How would you address those potential concerns? Yeah, I mean, we&#39;ve just had a good conversation about how floor area ratio and height is going to remain consistent. So I think these are really potential concerns coming from residents regarding the possible change. In shape. And I&#39;m just curious if there&#39;s an analysis from the department on whether. There could be sort of concerns about building lighting or, or like, or view corridor where the, the shape makes a meaningful difference. In the, in that being an issue. Yeah. So I guess first, just to clarify. In terms of the type of construction. We don&#39;t expect that there would be a difference between. You know, steel and concrete construction versus panelized or modular construction. In terms of how they would look. We don&#39;t expect that. We don&#39;t expect that. We don&#39;t expect that. We don&#39;t expect that. And I think that, you know, all those different types of construction would tend to have the same form. And. You know, in terms of the. Obviously one of the intents here is to make it easier to build housing. So we might, it is possible. We might see housing online lots where we might not otherwise see it because of this change. But in terms of the shape itself again, you know, on most lots. You probably wouldn&#39;t see a lot of shape. Differences from the street. So on most lots, probably the shape wouldn&#39;t change that much. This is again, that example. If there&#39;s no green street. You, it is possible. There could be small changes in terms of how close they get to the alley. But in general. Developers tend to want to, you know, Have windows abutting those and have reserved things for the. The light. Well, so on most lots. You probably wouldn&#39;t see a lot of shape. But then obviously on, on green streets, we are proposing to change the green street setback so that it is. You know, it starts lower to the street, but it&#39;s more consistent. Again, but we are only allowing that on the north side of, of the green streets. There definitely would be a visual impact for sure. But it shouldn&#39;t have an impact on the amount of light. That was gets down to those green streets. So I think. So overall. There definitely would be small changes. You know, as we, I think we talked to people about. These changes, you know, there&#39;s. They would be a little bit wider at the top, which might make them look a little bit bulkier, but they would be a little bit wider at the top. So I think that&#39;s a good point. I think that&#39;s a good point. We, we didn&#39;t. They don&#39;t seem to be very large visual districts. Just distinctions. And they really are. We&#39;re designed to really not have much impact on, on light that gets the street. Cause that&#39;s obviously something that&#39;s very important in these neighborhoods. And on the few quarter issue, the legislation does not. So I think that&#39;s a good point. Thank you for confirming that. So pivoting to, to a little bit of the conversation around the potential environmental impact. And maybe I mentioned this when you were in the committee last time on this. I don&#39;t completely recall, but. Do you anticipate that this change and the possibility that these buildings are going to be more environmentally conscious. And less CO2 intensive. Do we see a connection between this and incentivizing that kind of development on, on. The lots that are sort of uniquely situated here. And how we might be making that more viable. Care to comment on that at all. Yeah. So, yeah. So obviously one of the intents of this legislation is to try and make it. Easier for innovative construction approaches to be used. Obviously we&#39;re not trying to. Kind of prefer them over other types. You know, this would help basically anybody who wants to develop. Through any kind of, of, of approach, but we do want to make it feasible so that people can start piloting and testing those things. And we do know that there&#39;s a lot of, You know, from past examples and current building practices, that it does penalize and modular construction does tend to use mess materials because it&#39;s done in a factory. And where, where, you know, they can. They don&#39;t have the same kind of waste that they would on, when they build on site. A lot of these. You know, cross laminated timber is something that we&#39;re not. You know, cross laminated timber is something that we&#39;re not yet seeing much, but we&#39;ve recently amended the building code to make it much easier. And we&#39;re hopeful over the couple of years that it could be a practice that would be really useful in sites like this. So we&#39;re hoping that it will encourage that as well. In terms of our environmental analysis, we didn&#39;t try to quantify that because there&#39;s obviously a lot of what else and different types of companies that are doing this work. But certainly, one of the purposes of this is to kind of make that type of construction possible, because it does have a number of environmental benefits, as well as potentially holding the possibility of helping to reduce the cost of construction in the long term. All right, thank you. I don&#39;t have any additional questions, Mr. Chair. Excellent. Those are really good questions. Other council members seeing no questions, we&#39;ll open the remote public hearing and then we&#39;ll take some votes on suspending the rules, if you&#39;re comfortable, and then a vote on the legislation if you&#39;re comfortable. So, before we open the remote public hearing I would again ask that everyone please be patient as we continue to learn to operate this new system in real time and navigate through the inevitable growing pains. We are continuously looking for the ways to fine tune this process and adding new features that allow for additional means of public participation in our council meetings. I will moderate the public hearing in the following manner. Each speaker will be given two minutes to speak. I will call on one speaker at a time and in the order in which you registered on the council&#39;s website. If you have not yet registered and would like to speak, you can sign up for the end of public hearing by going to the council&#39;s website at sale.gov forward slash council. The link is also on today&#39;s agenda. Once I call on the speaker&#39;s name staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt if you&#39;ve been unmuted will be the speaker&#39;s cue that it is their turn to speak. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item in which you are addressing as a reminder public comment should relate to Council Bill 120153. If you have comments about something that is not on today&#39;s agenda you can always provide written comments by emailing my office. Again, this public hearing is just on Council Bill 120153, the small lot. Belltown small lots. Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of your allotted time. I will thank you as your time concludes. And once you hear the chime as 10 seconds are left, please begin to wrap up your public comments. If speakers do not end their comments by the end of the allotted time provided the speaker&#39;s microphone will be muted to allow us to call the next speaker. Once you&#39;ve completed your, your comment we ask you please disconnect from the line and if you plan to continue following this meeting please do so via the Seattle channel or the listening options on the agenda. And with that the public hearing on Council Bill 120153 is now open and we will begin with the first speaker on the list. We have 1234567 speakers listed. Tom Eames, Ken Phillips, and Alan Klein, you are not present so please refer to the email that you received and call in now. If you are on the listen line you are in the wrong place. So I&#39;ll run down the list so everyone knows where they are and then we&#39;ll get going. So with that, and no further ado, good morning, Megan, how are you today. Hi, good morning. Can you hear me. We can. Okay, great. Thank you. Yes, I want to talk about CB 120153. This bill will increase the width of Belltown small lot buildings and reduce requirements for their upper level setbacks. Building width and setbacks are elements put in the code specifically to protect light and air to adjacent buildings in the street. As written, this legislation erodes environmental quality and livability in the built environment and expedites modular property development. It&#39;s a tradeoff we don&#39;t need to make. Both from environmental and social perspectives, we need to consider that buildings last for generations. They should be constructed to leave a lasting positive impact. People need light and air. They make urban villages and neighborhoods livable and equitable. It&#39;s a mistake to think we can&#39;t preserve both public health and the environment and still develop economically. There&#39;s a sustainable architect in Belltown named Tom Eames, I hope he speaks today, who has submitted an analysis and modest amendments to this bill that provide for modular construction, while maintaining adequate light to neighboring buildings and streets. We really can and should do both. Please don&#39;t vote on this bill today and break protocol. When the bill was introduced during council briefing on Monday, it was not brought up as one to be voted on. Please take time, discuss his amendments, and hopefully adopt them. Thank you. Thank you, Megan. It was great to hear your voice. Up next is Michael Mann, followed by Howard Anderson, then Tom Eames. If you call in, Tom, you are not present at this time. Michael Mann, take it away. Good morning. Good morning, Chair Strauss and committee members. My name is Michael Mann, and I&#39;m here today representing Sustainable Living Innovations in support of Council Bill 120153. SLI is a Seattle-based company that has been developing a pre-manufactured building system for over a decade. The company manufactures walls and floors in its Tacoma factory and then assembles them at the job site. This innovation and building allows SLI to engineer greater sustainability and affordability into its projects. Its first building in the University District uses 70% less energy than a typical residential unit. In June, SLI broke ground on the world&#39;s first net-zero energy multifamily high-rise in Belltown called 303 Battery. That project will also include 27 rent-restricted affordable units. Council Bill 120153 is important to SLI because its pre-manufactured product is essentially limited to a box shape. Upper floor setbacks are not possible. What SLI can do with this technology is to build on small lots. The 303 Battery project will have 112 units on a parcel that is just 6,500 square feet. That may be the most dense housing project in the city. SLI and its technology can help the city achieve its sustainability and housing affordability goals. This legislation will provide greater opportunities to achieve those goals in the Belltown neighborhood. Thank you for your consideration and support of the bill. Thank you, Michael. Up next, we have Howard Anderson, followed by Tom Eanes, if he calls in, and then Jimmy Blase. That would bring, following Jimmy, is Ken Phillips Jr. and Alan Klein. All three, Tom, Ken, and Alan, are not present at this time. If you would like to testify, please call in to the line on the email that was sent to you. Howard Anderson, good morning. Yes, good morning.
Will we have a roll? Present. Council Member Juarez. Here. Council Member Mosqueda. Chair Strauss. Present. Before present. Thank you. The Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee of the City of Seattle. We begin this committee meeting, as always, by acknowledging that we are on the traditional and ancestral lands of the first people of this region, past and present. Represented in a number of tribes and as urban natives. And we honor with gratitude the land itself and the people of this land. We start with this land acknowledgement at each committee to recognize the fact that we are guests on this land and should steward our land and our process as such as guests. This is not a checklist or a rote behavior. It doesn&#39;t give us a passport to proceed however we desire. We must instead take this moment to reflect that we must steward our work here as guests as our time on earth is short. Thank you. At today&#39;s committee, this is a special meeting of the Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee because we had to reschedule our committee meeting from earlier this month to observe Rosh Hashanah. We have six items on today&#39;s agenda. The majority are items that were discussed in this past Wednesday&#39;s committee. And we have one other item, which is the Treat Report, which we&#39;ll get to. So of our six items today, we have a discussion and vote on Council Bill 120181, which adopts a regional transferable development rights program with Pierce and Snohomish County. Second, we have a discussion and vote on Council Bill 120155, which amends the comprehensive plan to change the name of single family areas to neighborhood residential areas. We have a discussion and vote on Council Bill 120154, which makes several other annual amendments to the comprehensive plan. Following that, we will have a discussion and vote on Council Bill 120149, which increases the maximum size limit for sports and recreational uses in industrial general two zones. And a briefing on the public engagement plan for the comprehensive plan major update. And lastly, a briefing on the quarterly tree report from SDCI and OSC. This is a long agenda, so I&#39;m hopeful that we can move through some of these items quickly as we have discussed them in the committee just two days ago. The next regularly scheduled meeting of the Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee is after Council&#39;s budget process on Wednesday, December 8th, 2021, beginning at 930 a.m. We may need to schedule special meetings during the budget process to consider a contract rezone in the state required timeline. And before we begin, if there is no objection, the agenda will be adopted. Hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted. At this time, we will open the remote public comment period for the items on today&#39;s agenda. We will be providing – there are 14 – 12 people signed up for public comment today. To keep us within the 20 minutes of public comment, I&#39;m going to provide one minute to each individual to speak, especially in case others sign up as we are in public comment. So, at this time, we will open the remote public comment period for items on today&#39;s agenda. Before we begin, I ask that everyone please be patient as we learn to operate this new system in real time. While it remains our strong intent to have public comment regularly included on meeting agendas, the City Council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem that the system is being abused or is unsuitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner in which we are able to conduct our necessary business. I will moderate the public comment period in the following manner. Public comment period for this meeting is up to 10 minutes – sorry, let&#39;s just extend it to 14 minutes at the outset, and each speaker will be given one minute to speak. I will call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the council&#39;s website. If you have not yet registered to speak and would like to, you can sign up before the end of public comment by going to the council&#39;s website. The public comment link is also listed on today&#39;s agenda. Once I call on a speaker&#39;s name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt if you have been unmuted will be the speaker&#39;s cue that it is their turn to speak. Please begin by stating your name and the item in which you are addressing. Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of the allotted time. Once a speaker hears the chime and we ask that you please begin to wrap up your public comments. If speakers do not end their public comments at the end of the allotted time provided, the speaker&#39;s microphone will be muted after 10 seconds to allow us to call on the next speaker. Once you&#39;ve completed your public comments, we ask that you please disconnect from the line and if you plan to continue following this meeting, please do so via the Seattle channel or the listening options listed on the agenda. The public comment period is now open and we will begin with the first speaker on the list. For the record, I would also like to note that Councilmember Vice Chair Mosqueda has joined the meeting. I will first give you an overview so everyone knows where on the list they are located. Bringing this up now, we have Ray Dubicki, followed by Steve Zemke, Martha Baskin, Rebecca Schwartzman, Anna Pedroso, Michael Oxman, Erica Berg, Richard Ellison, David Mooring, Suzanne Grant, Woody Wheeler, and then a couple duplicates. Those who are not present at this time are Martha Baskin, Anna Pedroso, and Erica Berg. Please, Martha, Anna, and Erica, you have received an email after you&#39;ve signed up for public comment that gives you the instructions to call in. If you are on the listen line, you&#39;re in the wrong place. Please refer to the email in which you have received. First up, we have Ray Dubicki, followed by Steve Zemke. Ray, good afternoon. I see you there. Just press star six, not pound six. You&#39;ll be able to take it away. There you are. Thank you, Councilmember. Thank you, committee. I&#39;m Ray Dubicki speaking on CB120149. I get to advocate and write about industrial lands in and around Interbay. Two concerns about the proposed bill, spot zoning and changing industrial uses. First, I asked the committee to specifically discuss the rules of changing development standards. Wednesday&#39;s meeting included a lot about how this process is not spot zoning. Could you tell the city a little bit more about what is actually happening? When is it appropriate to change these development standards and where has the city done it before? Second, the concern about how this facility fits into industrial Interbay is very real. If this was a 50,000 square foot LA fitness, we would all agree it doesn&#39;t fit. Some of this conflict is in the contradictory statements of the last meeting. Is this a general rule or will this activate the neighborhood and have That gets to the broadest picture. I want the storm to have a world class practice facility, but addressing concerns about litigation and delays will strengthen throughout the whole city&#39;s industrial lands. Thank you, Ray. Always great to hear from you. Up next, we have Steve Zemke, followed by Martha Baskin. Martha, you are not present at this time. Rebecca Schwartzman follows Martha. Good afternoon, Steve. Steve Zemke, representing 3PAC. Want to note that in the SDCI tree report, it talks about developing initial recommendations and identifying possible implementation updates, etc. But what isn&#39;t there at all is a tree ordinance draft. It then says to look in December as targeting to issue SEPA discussion recommendations. That&#39;s known as a determination of non-significance. You cannot do that without an actual ordinance before the public. That is biasing the process and eliminating the public from being involved in the draft. Also sent out to the council a polling results from 3PAC and Northwest Progressive Institute that you should look at that shows 80 to 70 to 80% support for provisions that you&#39;ve outlined in your council resolution to update the tree ordinance. Thank you. Thank you, Steve. Martha Baskin, you are present. Thank you for calling in. You&#39;re up next. Press star 6. There you are. Good afternoon, Martha. Good afternoon, all. Yes, regarding the proposed changes to Seattle&#39;s comprehensive plan, I&#39;d like to know how changing the name single family to neighborhood residential will encourage affordable housing and preservation of mature tree canopy. Over the last decade, there have been a dozen significant up zones that more than doubled Seattle&#39;s own capacity. Since 2015, the city has added nearly 53,000 new residential units, nearly all expensive and completely out of reach for frontline communities, food workers, and educators, and definitely out of reach for the unhoused. How will the new plan change this pattern? In 2019, when accessory dwelling units were approved, the requirement for preserving a minimum of two inches of tree diameter for each 1,000 square feet lot was omitted. Will the zoning change restore this requirement, or is it the city&#39;s view that those who live in ADUs would prefer to live in a setting without canopy? What is the current status of tree loss in the city? Some data show a very small amount of tree loss, but as anyone living in Seattle knows. Thank you, Martha. And if there&#39;s more that you&#39;d like to email to us, on the screen right now is the email address, council.seattle.gov, or you can email me directly. Rebecca Schwartz, I see you&#39;re off mute. You&#39;re next. Welcome. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Thank you, Chair Strassel and committee members. My name is Rebecca, and I am calling on behalf of FORTERRA to ask that you please support the ordinance to update the city&#39;s regional TDR program as it is drafted. Along with key partners such as King County and the city, FORTERRA was the chief architect of the regional TDR program that Seattle has been using since 2013. The program has exceeded expectations, both in terms of the conservation outcomes in the county and in terms of how much new revenue it is generating for public improvements that support growth in the city&#39;s urban core. The spirit and letter of state law creating this program is for participating cities to accept TDR credits from Pierce, King, and Snohomish County. And by only accepting credits from King County, Seattle is out of compliance with statute, and the ordinance before you today is a simple technical update that remedies the issue and will open the door to the use of TDR credits from all three counties. Demand for regional TDR in the city remains robust, as new high-rise developments have been proposed that would need to buy TDR credits through the regional program. Thank you for your time today, and please send the ordinance as drafted to council. Thank you. Thank you, Rebecca. Up next, we have Anna Pedroso. But, Anna, you are not present. Erica Berg, you are also not present. If you are listening, please follow the instructions on the email sent to you. If you&#39;re on the listen line, that&#39;s not the right place. We will move on to Michael Oxman, followed by Richard Ellison and Dave Mooring. If Anna and Erica, if you call in, we&#39;ll get you back in the queue. Michael, good afternoon. I see you&#39;re here. Press star six and take it away. Not pound six, star six, if you would. Mr. Oxman? If we could move on to Richard, we&#39;ll come back to Michael Oxman at the end. Michael, just remember to press star six next time. We&#39;ll come back to you. Richard Ellison, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Thank you. I&#39;d like to address both the changes from the single family zoning to the neighborhood label and also the fact that there&#39;s no tree ordinance yet. It&#39;s not possible to change the zoning and not have significant changes. This idea that it&#39;s just a language change and it has no significant impact is absurd. We know this is going to go from single families to creating multiplex homes in single family zoned areas. Currently, this is going to have potential tremendous impact to the canopy, as the majority of the canopy in Seattle is in single family zoning. So if there is going to be a large zoning change in this capacity, there needs to be a serious environmental impact statement. You can&#39;t have a serious environmental impact in place. If there&#39;s not going to be a tree ordinance, then that will be evaluated. If there&#39;s a plan to be one, then it is required that you cannot give a DNS to anything on a zoning change without having done a significant environmental impact state. Thank you, Richard. If you have more to say, please do send it to me at dan.straus at seattle.gov or council at seattle.gov. Up next, we have Dave Mooring, followed by Suzanne Grant and then Woody Wheeler. We will come back to Michael Oxman, Anna Pedroso and Erika Berg. Anna and Erika, you are still not present. Good afternoon, Dave. I see you&#39;re already off the mute and take it away. Thank you, Council Member Straus. My name is David Mooring, a Seattle architect and also a member of CPAC. I would like the council members present to go to the report slide 9 and 10, where it basically has the strategies that are being presented. And notice how many of those strategies seem to be missing those recommendations that were made from the Urban Forestry Commission a couple of years ago. The city of Seattle is the 10th worst in the nation as it comes to urban heat and highland effects. And urban forest is really only the way to combat that all over the city. We currently have 2016, 28% tree cover, as you know. I&#39;m anticipating, like any other city, we&#39;re going to drop to about 25 to 26%. And relying on, you know, this to happen by chance to grow our canopy while we grow our density is not going to happen. So we really need stronger strategies presented. We need to know that the trees are going to be where to plant the trees and that every site in residential properties will contribute to tree planting. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate you testifying today. Up next, we have Suzanne Grant, followed by Woody Wheeler. We&#39;ll come back to Michael Oxman and then Anna and Erica. You&#39;re still not present. Good afternoon, Suzanne. I see you&#39;re already off mute. Take it away. Good afternoon. This is Suzanne Grant. I&#39;m commenting about the tree ordinance report. First, I want to thank CM Peterson for taking responsibility around the tree issue. I hope you read his newsletters. He is the only one on this committee that actually cares. The rest of you are either mute on the issue or talk obliquely around it. Does SDCI control the city&#39;s policy on trees? Does OSC or does the Seattle City Council have power to save the mature and exceptional trees that we have left? Where is the tree ordinance draft? Now, there&#39;s yet another delay until December 2021 in SDCI&#39;s, quote, progress. Why don&#39;t you listen to UFC&#39;s recommendations? So many of us care deeply about trees and how they can help. Have you read Linda Mates? We take our time without pay, CM Strauss, to comment and work continually looking for ways to stop the clear cutting of Seattle. What are you doing? The next time you see a lot of trees, including the exceptional ones, take a good look in the mirror and wonder if you could have actually done something to save them. Thank you. Thank you, Suzanne. Always great to hear from you. Up next is Woody Wheeler. Woody, I see you&#39;re there and off mute. Take it away. Thank you very much. I&#39;m talking about the tree ordinance also. Seattle likes to think of itself as a progressive, green, forward thinking city. But we are resting on our laurels. Other cities are far more progressive than Seattle in terms of tree protection. Those cities understand the importance of tree canopy to the health of all of their residents, especially the BIPOC and lower income communities who often live in tree scarce urban heat islands and cannot simply turn up the air conditioning. We are trying to reach a 30% tree canopy in Seattle and are likely backsliding, as David Mooring mentioned earlier. Meanwhile, there are four major cities that have already surpassed our tree canopy goal, including New York City, 39%, Atlanta, 36%, Tampa, 36%, and Portland, 32%. A recent poll shows a whopping 80% of Seattleites support stronger tree protections. Right now, city council and the mayor are way behind their constituents when it comes to tree protections. It is time to catch up to the 80%. Thank you. Thank you, Woody. Michael, I see you&#39;re back, and you&#39;re off mute. Welcome, Michael. Take it away. Good afternoon. Hey, how&#39;s it going? This is Michael Oxman calling. I just wanted to let you know that Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 25.11.090 is a Seattle law requiring replanting of exceptional trees with specimens that will grow as large as the exceptional tree being removed. This law was passed by the city council as a way to prevent attrition of the urban forest. The PowerPoint slide shows current strategy, however, does not mention this law or even this concept of tree replacement as a way to keep Seattle&#39;s ecology healthy. The method used by SMC 25.11.090 to ensure that canopy replacement is achieved is to require enough soil space for the newly replanted tree to allow its roots to mature. This law uses the term designed to describe and mandate both the sampling and the site where it will live for the following few decades. The PowerPoint slideshow says we will seek to identify. Thank you, Michael, and please do feel free to send in any additional written comments. Anna Pedroso, Erica Berg, I am seeing that you are not listed as present. If you would also like to send in your written comments to dan.straus at Seattle.gov or council at Seattle.gov, we would gladly put your comments on the record. IT, can you confirm there are no further registrants for public comment at this time? There are no other public comment registrants. Thank you. Seeing as we have no additional speakers remotely present, we will move on to the next agenda item. Item number one, our first item of business today is council bill 120181, which adopts a regional transferable development rights program. Will you please read the abbreviated title into the record? Agenda item one, council bill 120181, an ordinance amending sections of the Seattle municipal code to facilitate the transfer of development rights from Pierce and Snohomish counties to Seattle. Thank you. We are joined today by Ketel Freeman, council central staff, as well as representatives from King County and Snohomish County who are here to share a bit about how this legislation could impact the region around us. Will you each introduce yourselves? I&#39;ll go ahead and start, and then maybe I&#39;ll popcorn it to Michael. Ketel Freeman, council central staff. Thanks, Ketel. Michael Murphy. I run the transfer development rights program at King County. Steve Skorney, senior planner with Snohomish County, and I&#39;m the TDR coordinator for the county. Excellent. Thank you for coming today, Steve. Really appreciate it. And same to you, Michael. Great to have you. I know that we had this briefing in committee just the other day. Could you just provide us a brief reminder of what the legislation does? Sure. I&#39;ll be very brief. On Wednesday, I went through some of the legislative history. I won&#39;t do that again. I&#39;ll just remind the committee that this iteration of the city&#39;s regional TDR program dates back to 2013, required multiple ordinances to implement. Collectively, all of those ordinances established a TDR program with King County. The city was utilizing authority that came from the state through the advocacy of Hortera, back in 2007. What does Council Bill 120181 do? It amends the land use code to adopt by reference a chapter in the Washington Administrative Code, that&#39;s WAC 365-198. Adoption by reference obviates the need for the city to enter into local agreements with Pierce or Snohomish counties for TDR programs. I think I mentioned this on Wednesday, but in the city&#39;s regulatory framework for TDRs, we have what are called exchange rates for development rights that could be transferred from both Pierce and Snohomish counties. WAC 365-198 essentially establishes minimum requirements for cities and towns. Those are where the receiving sites are, and minimum requirements for counties. Those are where the sending sites are, and joint requirements for both cities and counties when it comes to reporting to each other about transferable development rights. One thing that I mentioned on Wednesday is that it&#39;s not clear to me that this is self-executing. There may still need to be regulatory changes made in Pierce and Snohomish counties. Perhaps Mr. Skornek can speak to that for Snohomish County. But that, in a nutshell, is what Council Bill 120181 does. Thank you, Mr. Freeman. Michael, we heard from, and it was great to hear from you during the public hearing on Wednesday. Would you be able to share a bit of King County&#39;s perspective on this legislation and the TDR program? Absolutely. Thanks for having me, Chair Strauss and other members of the committee. Yeah, King County has been the beneficiary of the agreement with Seattle since 2013, and it&#39;s a major, the demand for the transferable development rights from King County is a major driver for conservation in King County. So we&#39;ve used this tool to great effect. I believe personally, and we as a county believe that conservation is a regional endeavor. Chair Strauss, you spoke about it on Wednesday, driving to Mount Rainier, you&#39;re driving through Pierce County or going up to, looking at the foothills and looking up north. It&#39;s really, there&#39;s the conservation regionally benefits all of the residents in the region, and with Seattle&#39;s growth, we have an opportunity through the transfer of development rights mechanism to spread the benefit to the region. There&#39;s one other element that I&#39;d like to highlight, and that&#39;s that for farming in particular, and this, the agreement that King County and Seattle have had since 2013 has done a lot to protect farms in King County. Since 2013, over 2,000 acres at 36 different farms have been permanently protected from future development. Farming works best when there are other farmers who can farm their land too. So if we have a agricultural economy that spans three counties, that&#39;s better for the farmers than just protected farms in King County. So there really are benefits to permanently conserving forest land, farm land, river corridors, other natural lands throughout the region on a regional scale, not just in one county alone. And of course, this legislation would open the door to Pierce and Snohomish counties to be able to share in some of the conservation benefits that King County has enjoyed through this partnership. So unless there are questions, that&#39;s really the point I wanted to make in addition to what I said at the meeting on Wednesday. So I urge your support for this legislation. King County supports this. Thank you, Michael. Before we hear from Steve, Michael, I understand you may have a map to visually describe what you just said. Sure. I will show you a property map that is on King County&#39;s website. You can get there by going to kingcounty.gov and looking for the property map. What&#39;s showing on my screen right now, are you seeing my screen? Yes, we are. Very good. The green dots are the sites throughout King County that have been permanently protected. Each of those represents a property, some of which are many parcels, some of which are just a single parcel. This shade of green are the polygons representing the land that&#39;s permanently protected. So you can see major forest blocks. This is the Snoqualmie Forest, which if I had my shades drawn up right now, I could see out my window and look at this. This is the headwaters of the Green River down here. When you scroll in to the farmland in the Snoqualmie Valley, you can see individual farms that we have permanently protected. Many of the deals of the conservation acquisitions that are shown on this map have been driven by demand for transferable development rights from Seattle developers. The orange dots on the map are where the transferable development rights have landed, where they&#39;ve been used. You can see a cluster in downtown Danny Triangle and Southlake Union, which is the areas of Seattle where King County transferable development rights can be used. And then a smattering of sites in some other jurisdictions and unincorporated urban King County areas. So this map is available for any to see. It&#39;s interactive. If you can click any dot and learn more attributes. But the point is that there are this is a very powerful tool for conservation in the region, and we urge your support for this bill so that it can accrue to Pearson Snohomish County as well. Thank you, Michael. This map really does demonstrate how different Eastern King County is and that tracks with Snohomish and Pierce County as compared to Western County. And as I was saying on Wednesday, when we look out at the mountains from Seattle or we drive up to index or down to Mount Rainier, if we want to continue driving through forests and farmland rather than looking at continued expansion of development that is not dense, we need to use this program. Thank you. Very good. I will stop sharing now if that sounds. All right, very good. Steve, please. We&#39;re really quite excited to have you and thank you for being here earlier this year. I was able to meet with County Executive Dave Summers to discuss the need for regional TDR program. Can you share a little bit about how Snohomish County could benefit from this change? OK, well, thank you, Chair Strauss. Well, I&#39;ve been involved with this program since its inception back in 2013, and we had worked with Fort Terror over the years in terms of trying to draft legislation, both policy and implementing code here. And so we&#39;ve had this program, and it&#39;s actually sort of in its infancy compared to King County. King County has had a successful TDR program for many decades, and we hope to catch up somewhat to what King County&#39;s success has been. And so we&#39;ve only currently only got a couple hundred acres or so of land that has been set aside through conservation easements through the TDR program. What we have up here in Snohomish County is we don&#39;t have a sort of TDR receiving area engine like there is down here with the City of Seattle and King County. Few cities in Snohomish County have adopted any type of TDR legislation, and we&#39;ve worked with them. But there just hasn&#39;t been any real demand by developers to purchase any of the TDR credits from our resource land sending areas in Snohomish County. And the county does have, in fact, some receiving areas in urban unincorporated Snohomish County. But those areas are limited, and we&#39;ve had a little bit of success there. But the county is really supportive of the passage of this legislation here so we can enter into transferring those credits to the City of Seattle. And I should mention that as part of the authorizing legislation back in 2013, the county did adopt, by reference, that section of Washington Administrative Code to allow for transfer of those development rights without having to enter into interlocal agreements. So we&#39;re all set up on our end for sending those TDR credits once demand becomes available in Seattle. I should mention that our TDR sending areas are all our designated farm and forest lands on our comprehensive plan maps. And we have hundreds of thousands of acres of forest land, but we have a very finite amount of designated farmland. We have about 56,000 acres currently. And that agricultural land generates, well, this is a couple years ago, $139 million toward our county economy. So not only will this legislation help preserve and reduce the conversion of farmland in our county for, obviously, there&#39;s open space attributes, but it really is a key part of our economy up in the county there. And so we certainly would like to see that agricultural economy enhanced and grow. And hopefully, this participation by the City of Seattle in this regional TDR program will help us with that. I very well said, Steve. And I think that that also demonstrates that network that Michael was talking about, about across the tri-county area. As I was just saying, eastern county versus western county has kind of two distinct environments to it. And making sure there&#39;s good north-south connectivity from Snohomish down to Pierce County is going to be critical for that economy to thrive. Well, yeah. In fact, we have physical connections there.
I mean, the Snohomish River Valley, which you see as you drive up I-5 there, a portion of that valley is the Snoqualmie River Valley, which we have a portion of that in our county. And so that certainly extends out into King County. So yeah, you can easily see what preservation of farmland can do to our environment and just overall providing that preservation of open space, which is critical in our region. Very well said, Steve. And while Pierce County was unable to send a representative due to scheduling constraints, my staff has spoken with their TDR staff. And it&#39;s my understanding that Pierce County is also supportive of this change and are working to best implement regional TDR themselves. Colleagues, at this time, I want to double check to see if there are any questions for Steve, Michael, or Ketel. I know we just had this before us, but 48 hours, two days ago. So I am seeing no questions. Gentlemen, you&#39;ve done an excellent job at explaining this concept to us and the importance in both combating climate change and preserving the environment in which we enjoy throughout our region. If there is no further discussion before we vote, I guess we&#39;ll move on to voting. Thank you. So seeing as there&#39;s no further discussion before we vote on the legislation, I will move to recommend passage of Council Bill 120181. Is there a second? Second. Thank you, Council Member Peterson. It has been moved and seconded to recommend passage of Council Bill 120181. Will the clerk please call the roll? Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Juarez? Yes. Council Member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Strauss? Aye. Chair Strauss? Yes. Five in favor, none opposed. Thank you. The motion carries. This legislation will be back before the full Council on Monday, October 4th for a final vote. Up next is Council Bill 120155, which will amend the comprehensive plan to change the name of single-family areas to neighborhood residential areas. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the abbreviated title into the record? Agenda Item 2, Council Bill 120155, an ordinance relating to land use and zoning, amending the comprehensive plan to change the name of single-family areas to neighborhood residential areas as part of the 2020-2021 comprehensive plan. Thank you, Mr. Ahn. This is now the third committee meeting at which we have discussed this change following an initial public hearing on July 28th and a second public hearing on Wednesday, this last Wednesday. It has also appeared on the Council&#39;s comprehensive plan amendment docket every year since 2019. As I&#39;ve shared previously, we are proposing the neighborhood residential name change for the simple fact that it most accurately reflects the reality of today. The neighborhoods we call single-family already include much more than just single-family homes. They include households with multiple families, as well as legacy duplexes, backyard cottages, in-law units, and apartment buildings built before the current zoning rules were applied. I&#39;ve been happy to co-sponsor this legislation with Councilmember Mosqueda, who has been working towards this moment since at least 2019. It&#39;s my understanding Councilmember Mosqueda will say more on this bill when it comes to full Council, but feel free to interrupt me, Councilmember Mosqueda, should you desire. I know that we just had this before committee two days ago, and Mr. Lish Whitson of Council Central staff is here as well. Lish, would you like to share a very brief refresher, or Council colleagues, do you have any questions at this time? I think you&#39;ve described the bill pretty well. It&#39;s both lengthy and simple. It changes the term single-family to neighborhood residential throughout the comprehensive plan. Thank you, Mr. Whitson, and I know I ask this question every time this comes up, and it&#39;s because the chief concern I&#39;ve heard with this legislation is a concern that the city does more than a simple name change. Lish, I know as I&#39;ve said, I&#39;ve asked this before, but can you confirm that this amendment only changes the name of single-family areas and does not change what is allowed to be built in these areas, is that correct? That is correct, yes. Thank you. Colleagues, any further questions? Councilmember Peterson, please take it away. Thank you, Chair Strauss. First, I want to thank you as our chair for giving us an opportunity to hear these bills more than once. It&#39;s very helpful. And because we might have a different audience listening in today, just quickly reiterate my comments from Wednesday. Originally, I&#39;ve been struggling with this legislation because I did hear from some concerned community leaders in my district about what it might mean or lead to, but as you had mentioned, as several staff reinforced, there&#39;s no substantive impact of the name change, and it does more accurately reflect the existing reality of housing uses in these geographic areas. So I&#39;ll be voting yes today. What will really matter to me is what might come next. So I just want to reiterate, I generally don&#39;t support blanket up zones unless there are clear, compelling, immediate public benefits, such as the creation of on-site, very low-income housing, and ideally, the additional densities located near frequent transit. Among sufficient infrastructure, such as school capacity, and that we put in place mitigation to prevent demolition of existing naturally occurring affordable housing and prevent the loss of mature tree canopy before we put those changes, mitigations in place before we implement substantive zoning changes. So I&#39;m fine with this name change and look forward to a robust and fact-based discussion of the impact of the current and proposed up zones in the future. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Peterson. Colleagues, if there are no further questions or discussion, we do have an amendment to consider today. It&#39;s technical in nature, coming at the request of Councilmember Herbold. Councilmember Mosqueda and I are co-sponsoring the amendment. Before we bring that up, I will need to move the bill for consideration. So at this time, I move to recommend passage of Council Bill 120155. Is there a second? Second. Thank you, Councilmember, Vice Chair Mosqueda, with the second. Coming back to Amendment 1, Councilmember Mosqueda and I are co-sponsoring Amendment 1 to our legislation as requested by Councilmember Herbold. It corrects awkward language in two neighborhood plans that result from a neighborhood residential name change specifically in the Morgan Community Plan and the Northgate Neighborhood Plan. Lish, could you share just a little bit more? Yeah, both Morgan Junction and Northgate refer currently to single-family neighborhoods in their neighborhood plans. Changing the phrase single-family to neighborhood residential would result in the phrase neighborhood residential neighborhoods. And the amendment would change those two instances from neighborhood residential neighborhood to neighborhood residential area. Thank you. Well said, Lish. Any further questions or comments on this amendment? Or Vice Chair Mosqueda, please take it away. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate the opportunity to work with you on this legislation and also to help co-sponsor this legislation along with the support of Councilmember Herbold. Happy to move this language along as I think that it really helps to make sure folks know that we&#39;re really considering removing redundancy in the language in two of the neighborhood plans resulting from the shift to neighborhood residential. I think this is in alignment with the Planning Commission. They&#39;ve recommended consistency across neighborhood plans and how we approach the name change and making sure that all neighborhood plans receive the same consideration in order to be in compliance with the legislation in front of us. We are being equitable in our approach. So I want to thank you. I want to thank central staff for helping to identify all of the neighborhood plans that have slightly different nuances in their language. And these are the only two that are included in this amendment, the Morgan Junction and Northgate. So I&#39;m very supportive of this change. And I think it helps to comply with our desire for more consistency. And I think it&#39;s a minor tweak that helps maintain the integrity of the legislation in front of us. Happy to help move this forward to accomplish our goal of a single name, which is universal in its approach, neighborhood residential. Thanks so much. Thank you, Vice Chair. If there&#39;s no further discussion, I will move to vote on this amendment. Seeing none, I move to amend Council Bill 120155 as shown in Amendment 1 on the agenda. Is there a second? Second. Thank you, Vice Chair and Council Member Peterson. It has been seconded. It has been moved and seconded to amend Council Bill 120155 as shown in Amendment 1. Will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Juarez? Yes. Council Member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Strauss? Yes. Five in favor and none opposed. The motion carries. We are now going to move to vote on the amended bill. Double checking. Is there further discussion or questions? Seeing none at this time, I move to recommend passage of Council Bill 120155 as amended. Is there a second? Second. Thank you, Vice Chair. It has been moved and seconded to recommend passage of Council Bill 120155 as amended. Will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Juarez? Yes. Council Member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Strauss? Yes. Five in favor and none opposed. Thank you. The motion carries. This legislation will be back before full council on Monday, October 4th. We are moving quickly because we have so many items on the agenda and many of these we discussed just a couple days ago. Moving on to, and of course because it&#39;s Friday and it&#39;s beautiful and still, it&#39;s one of the first days of autumn and we still have great weather. So thank you for being patient with me. Our next item of business is Council Bill 120154, which makes more annual amendments to the Comprehensive Plan. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the abbreviated title into the record? Agenda item three, Council Bill 120154, an ordinance relating to land use and zoning, amending the Seattle Comprehensive Plan to incorporate changes proposed as part of the 2021 Comprehensive Plan annual amendment process. Thank you. We are joined once again by Lish Whitson of Central Staff. Lish, would you provide a reminder of the amendments contained in this legislation and the amendment before us? Yeah. So there are two sets of amendments that will be in the bill after you consider the amendment that&#39;s before you. So let me try and be less confusing about how many amendments you&#39;re talking about. In the bill, currently there are three sets of amendments. One is related to the University District. It would add a half block to the University District Urban Center. That half block is along the west side of 15th Avenue Northeast, just south of the Ravenna Boulevard. The second amendment is at 130th and I-5 near the future light rail station and would amend the future land use map to change a block in between the future light rail station and Jefferson Park golf course to a mix of commercial and multifamily areas from single family. Also in the bill are a couple of amendments related to the manufacturing industrial study. Environmental review is still continuing for those amendments and so you have an amendment in front of you to remove those from the bill pending further environmental review. And that&#39;s amendment one attached to your agenda. Thank you and just to lift up what you just said, we have an amendment to the bill to remove the aspects from the maritime and industrial lands process as they are now being moved into the EIS process. Colleagues, any questions at this time or discussion? Council Member Peterson. Thank you, Chair Strauss. Again, just in case we have a different audience viewing today, there is an amendment in my district, District 4 at the University District Urban Center boundary. I want to again thank Office of Planning and Community Development for reaching out to my office early to alert us to this proposal. Some nearby residents, community leaders had raised concerns and I want to explain why I support this particular up zone. The area is just 25% of the entire block. It&#39;s already multifamily housing. It&#39;s attached to the existing boundary of the urban center boundary. It&#39;s not across the street. It&#39;s at the intersection of two arterials. It&#39;s near frequent transit and other necessary infrastructure. And City Hall will have another crack at reviewing what actually happens on those parcels if something were to change. So I will be supporting it. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Peterson. If there&#39;s no further discussion, I will say that we should bring the amendment to the bill. And to do that, I will need to move this legislation. So at this time, I move to recommend passage of Council Bill 120154. Is there a second? Second. Second. Thank you, Council Member Juarez and Peterson. It has been moved and seconded. As we are now taking up Amendment 1, as described by Lish, this amendment removes the industrial lands amendments from the legislation. These amendments were included in the legislation when it was transmitted under the assumption we would be able to act on them this year. Due to the outstanding SEPA issues, they will not be considered until next year at the earliest. Lish, anything to add there? Colleagues, any questions, comments, or concerns on this amendment? Nothing to add from me. Council Member Peterson, is that a new hand or a residual? Take it away if you want to. It&#39;s a new hand. Real quick, I appreciate the effect statement on that Amendment 1, because originally when I read it, it was showing deletions of what could be some good ideas, but that was something that had been added and it&#39;s just being taken out. So, as I understand from the effect statement, no changes to industrial land policies would be affected with this, the approval of this amendment. Is that correct, Lish? Correct. If with this amendment, there will be no changes to maritime or industrial policies. Okay, thank you. Thank you. There&#39;s no further discussion. Let&#39;s vote on the amendment. Vote on the amendment. So, I at this time move to amend Council Bill 120154 as shown in Amendment 1 on the agenda. Is there a second? Second. Thank you, Council Member Peterson. It has been moved and seconded to amend Council Bill 120154 as shown in Amendment 1. Will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Flores? Yes. Council Member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Stroud? Yes. Five in favor, none opposed. Thank you. The motion carries.

Is there a second? Second. Thank you, Council Member Juarez and Peterson and Vice Chair Mosqueda. It has been moved and seconded to recommend passage of Council Bill 120154 as amended. Will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Juarez? Yes. Council Member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Stroud? Yes. Five in favor, none opposed. Thank you. The motion carries. And this bill will be before full Council on Monday, October 4th. Thank you, colleagues, for indulging me and moving quickly. Our next item of business today is item number four, Council Bill 120149, which increases the maximum size of sports and recreation uses in General 2, Industrial General 2 zones. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the abbreviated title into the record? Agenda item four, Council Bill 120149, an ordinance relating to land use and zoning, amending maximum size abuse limits and minimum parking requirements for indoor sports and recreation uses. Thank you. Mr. Lish Whitson of our Council Central staff is here with us. Lish, I know that we had a deep briefing about this on Wednesday. Can you refresh us on the legislation? Yeah. So this legislation will allow, would allow larger indoor sports and recreation facilities in a couple of areas of the Ballard Interbay North End Manufacturing Industrial Center, indoor sports and recreation facilities or facilities where people go to recreate or participate in sports indoors without a audience. So rather than a spectator sports facility, these are places like gyms, bowling alleys, sports clubs, and other facilities where any spectatorship is incidental to the activities that are occurring. The area, the, and currently in the general industrial zones, indoor sports and recreation facilities are limited to 10,000 square feet. The proposed legislation would expand that limitation to 50,000 square feet. In the Ben Mick Ballard Interbay North End Manufacturing Industrial Center, near neighborhood commercial and Seattle mix zones and parks with active recreation uses away from the shoreline and would limit sports facilities greater than 25,000 square feet so that there can&#39;t be two within a mile of each other. It also amends the parking regulations and reduces those. Thank you, Mr. Whitson. We did have a chance to discuss this legislation in depth on Wednesday, so I&#39;ll highlight just a few things that are motivating my strong support for this bill. Local governments have long supported their sports franchises for a year, whether it be the Seahawks, Mariners, Kraken, or Sounders, and it&#39;s important that we show the same support for our most winningest team, the Seattle Storm, who have more championships than any of those teams I just listed combined. I&#39;ll leave my comments there as I see Councilmember Lewis would like to speak. Councilmember Lewis, please take it away. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Is this a time for, I had some questions for Lish, I don&#39;t know if you want general comments. Yes, sir. Perfect time. Okay, great. So, Lish, this bill in front of us changes under certain circumstances how big existing uses in the BNBIC can be. Is that correct? Correct. So this ordinance in front of us is not a zoning ordinance because it&#39;s not permitting new uses. These are uses that are already allowed in the BNBIC, correct? Correct. I mean, it amends the zoning, but it does not change the zoning for particular properties. It changes the provisions of the land use code. Right, yeah. Thank you. Those are the only questions I had. Thank you, Councilmember Lewis, and you had great words as the district representative for Interbay. Of the 45 parcels that could be utilized under this law, they all reside in District 6 and District 7. Both of us are great supporters of the storm in this legislation. Councilmember Juarez, I see you have come off of mute. Would you like, no? Okay, just get ready to vote. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I&#39;m good. Yes, ma&#39;am. Councilmember Peterson, please take it away. Thank you, Chair Strauss. So during the past couple of days, I was able to conduct additional research on this legislation, which included conferring with our city attorney&#39;s office and completing other due diligence. And as I understand it, the type of land use proposed in the mayor&#39;s legislation is already allowed in this geographic area. The legislation will not endanger the good-paying jobs created by Seattle&#39;s maritime industry that we need to protect. And if the Seattle Storm professional basketball team uses this as an opportunity to build a training facility, I believe that would be a good development, a positive development, because the women&#39;s team provides great benefits to our city. Moreover, our district-based city council system, the view of the district council members who represent the geographic area is very important to me on issues like this, and I understand they support this legislation. So based in large part on these various factors, I&#39;ll be voting yes today for the committee. If there&#39;s any new information that contradicts what I&#39;ve used to make my decision thus far, then we can revisit during the full city council meeting. But I&#39;m a yes today, and thank you for bringing this forward. Thank you, Councilmember Peterson. Councilmember Lewis, I see you have your hand raised again. Yeah, thank you, Councilmember Strauss. I should just reiterate here publicly, given Councilmember Peterson&#39;s comments, that I do strongly support this legislation and appreciate Councilmember Peterson&#39;s words about acknowledging the view of the district council member in considering legislation like this. I did also, you know, I touched on this with my back and forth with Liz just now, but I do think since we did have a public commenter today talking about the spot zone thing, and it was an item of contention in the Seattle Times piece that was just written, you know, I don&#39;t want to get into the weeds on it, but I would just say as a threshold matter, you can&#39;t have a spot zone on a use that&#39;s already allowed in an area. Like a spot zone would be if we took some parcel in the middle of a single family neighborhood and let them build a fertilizer factory there. That&#39;s not what this is. We&#39;re allowing something to be bigger than it currently is that&#39;s already permitted in this zone that is a complementary use, and I just wanted to put that out there since it&#39;s been introduced as an issue. It&#39;s gotten a little bit more traction with a few additional people out there in the world, but just to put it to bed, like just categorically doesn&#39;t even meet the threshold to be considered as something like this, and I just want to make that as a brief comment. I agree with Judge Juarez. Thank you for your assessment. Thank you, Councilmember. Always good to defer to our judges. But I did want to just put that point in open session. It has been brought to my attention that I didn&#39;t provide specific examples of why it wasn&#39;t a spot zone last time, probably because we&#39;re not actually changing the zoning, but thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Councilmember Luis. I see Councilmember Juarez. I&#39;m just going to say quickly, thank you, Councilmember Peterson. We do defer, and I&#39;m glad that&#39;s why we went to a district system. Thank you for weighing in and supporting this because it is in your district, and I know you pay attention like I do on the ground what&#39;s going on with economic development, public assets, brick and mortar buildings, how this enhances, and thank you, Mr. Chair, because I know that you understand these issues. That&#39;s why you&#39;re in the chair of this committee, and with that, I hope that we have our colleagues support this today. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Juarez, and just briefly commenting on Councilmember Luis&#39;s comments, I know that there has been some speculation that this legislation could be a spot rezone, and after consulting with the city attorney&#39;s office, OPCD, the mayor&#39;s office, and my colleagues, I&#39;m confident that this is not a spot rezone. It does not allow any uses. It simply adjusts maximum sizes of sports and recreation facilities, a use that is already allowed in industrial general two zones. Because this is a use that is already allowed in these zones, it cannot be inconsistent with the surrounding uses. Any further comments? Otherwise, I will wrap us out with lifting up. Sue Bird provided testimony at the public hearing this week, and as Sue Bird shared at public comment on Wednesday, teams can lose their star players when they do not have the infrastructure to support their players. We have seen a beautiful new hockey facility open in Northgate this year. We&#39;re getting ready to inaugurate the Climate Pledge Arena in just a few weeks, and this legislation allows for another sports facility to be built in Seattle, something that will support our teams and create opportunities for residents of our city. We need to have our Seattle Storms back. We need to have our players back in this moment. We don&#39;t need them worrying about whether or not they have our support. We need their minds focused on the game so that they&#39;re focused simply on the court and so they can win our next championship. For anyone who is listening from the Storm, we are very excited and honored to have you as representatives of our city, and good luck on Sunday. We&#39;re here with you. There&#39;s no further discussion. I&#39;d like to bring this to a vote. Seeing no further discussion, I move to recommend passage of Council Bill 120149, is there a second? Second. It has been moved and seconded by Councilmember Juarez and Lewis. It is to recommend passage of Council Bill 120149. Will the clerk please call the roll? Councilmember Peterson? Yes. Councilmember Lewis? Yes. Councilmember Juarez? Yes. Councilmember Mosqueda? Councilmember Strauss? Yes. Four in favor, none opposed. The motion carries. This legislation will be back before the full council on Monday, October 4th. Let&#39;s go Storm! Thank you, colleagues. We are an hour into this special committee meeting and already on item five of six. The next two items have not been presented before in committee. The previous four have, so we may take a little bit slower, but I endeavor to get us out in a reasonable amount of time. Our next agenda item is a briefing from OPCD on the public engagement report for the comprehensive plan major update. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the abbreviated title into the record? Agenda item five, comprehensive major update public engagement report. Thank you. This report is required to lift a proviso on the public engagement budget for the comprehensive comprehensive plan major update. It will be important to deeply engage communities across Seattle as we work towards the major update in 2024, which will shape the future of growth in Seattle. We are joined by interim director Rico Quirendongo and Michael Hubner of OPCD. Gentlemen, please take it away. Good afternoon, Mr. Chair, council members. I should check to see whether my director Quirendongo has joined us. We are just moving too quickly. Yeah, he didn&#39;t anticipate you&#39;d be so speedy this afternoon, but he&#39;s empowered me to plow ahead with the sun shining. He may join us during my presentation. I know he has a few words that he wants to say as well and entertain your questions. Wonderful. I&#39;m going to share my screen and have a few slides to share with you. Are we good to go? Can you see that? We can see it. Take it away. Excellent. So, as I know the committee well knows, we are about to launch our comprehensive plan update. This plan is a 20-year guide for how our city grows and makes investments for a more equitable and resilient future. It&#39;s informed by our values. As well, every time we update the comprehensive plan, this effort is fundamentally shaped by broad and deep community engagement. The next update is due in 2024, and we are eager to roll up our sleeves and begin working with communities across the city on the update. What we&#39;re here to do today is to share with you our thinking, our game plan, if you will, for engaging with community over the next two and a half years or more as we work toward June 2024, when you will be considering the plan update for adoption. As Mr. Chair, you noted, this information is intended to satisfy the proviso for $100,000 as the first installment of a budget that would enable us to do a robust community engagement plan going forward. And we&#39;re eager to start that work during the fourth quarter of this year. So, this plan starts with articulating what our goals are for community engagement. We are very cognizant of the high expectations that community has for meaningful and deep and broad and equitable engagement related to this plan, and we know that we both have a citywide scope as well as at the neighborhood level to reach people in meaningful and interactive ways. We are centering our effort around race and equity, prioritizing marginalized communities, both in terms of hearing from them, engaging with them on this plan, but also building capacity for engagement over the long term. We are emphasizing effective communication that is meaningful and relevant. It&#39;s always a bit of a challenge with an effort like comprehensive planning, which is long term, covers many different policy topics, but we are aiming to rise to the challenge to make this a meaningful, relatable conversation about the future of the city using plain talk and graphics, multiple channels of communication and ability to have input on the plan, and making this effort accessible and multilingual. This meaningful engagement is not only about providing information to communities and to the public, but really it&#39;s hard about interaction, dialogue, and co-creation of a plan that meets our goals and our values going forward, and to be truly transparent, responsive, and accountable to the outcomes. So, guided by these goals, one of the first things we&#39;re doing as well is thinking about who we are trying to reach and how we are prioritizing our resources. First and foremost, in centering race and equity in this effort, we are prioritizing our limited resources to engage with marginalized communities, communities that have not had the access and the ability and the influence over citywide policymaking in the past, resulting in historical and ongoing harms, specifically BIPOC communities, limited English populations and refugees, immigrant communities, LGBTQ community, and people with disabilities.
Good morning, the December 8th, 2021 meeting of the land use and neighborhoods committee will come to order. It is 9.31 a.m. I&#39;m Dan Strauss, chair of the committee. Will the clerk please call the roll? Councilmember Peterson? Here. Councilmember Lewis? Here. Councilmember Juarez? Here. Councilmember Mosqueda? Present. Chair Strauss? Present. Five present. Thank you. As always, we begin our land use and neighborhoods committee of the City of Seattle with a land acknowledgment. As I say every time, this is a moment for reflection and pause before we endeavor in our business. And it&#39;s important that we don&#39;t let these words just become rote behavior or something that we just say to say them and then let us do whatever we want to do because we&#39;ve said some nice words. This is a moment where we pause and reflect about land and people because this is the land use committee. And so we begin with the City of Seattle land use committee by acknowledging we are on the traditional and ancestral lands of the first people of this region, past and present. Represented in a number of tribes and as urban natives. And we honor with gratitude the land and the people of this land. We start with this acknowledgment to recognize the fact that we are guests. Our time on earth is short. Our time in these positions of decision-making are short. And we must steward our work as guests so that we can leave to leave because we won&#39;t be here forever. And the actions that we make now will impact the people who come after us. And that is why it&#39;s important to start with acknowledging the first people of this region, past and present, because they have set up what we have today. So again, taking this moment to have reflection before we endeavor in our work on land use to honor the land itself and the people of this land. Thank you. Taking that reflection into the six items on the agenda today. We have a public hearing and vote on Council Bill 120206, which establishes an overlay district for manufactured home parks. We have a discussion and vote on Council Bill 120239, which updates the energy code. We have a public hearing and vote on Council Bill 120215, which waives some land use requirements for the West Point Treatment Facility. We have a public hearing and vote on Council Bill 120214, which amends the Seattle Municipal Code to implement the name change to neighborhood residential. We have a briefing and vote on Council Bill 120235, a landmark ordinance for 802 16th Avenue. And we have a quarterly tree report from SDCI and OSE. This is the final scheduled meeting of the Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee before the Council reorganizes in the new year. This is the end of the biennium, the two-year cycle. And we&#39;ll get going. But before we begin, if there&#39;s no objection, the agenda will be adopted. Hearing no objection, the agenda is adopted. At this time, we will open the remote public comment period for items on today&#39;s agenda. If you&#39;ve called in for a public hearing, this is not the right place. So if we call on you and you want to speak to a public hearing, but you&#39;re in public comment, please just let us know and we&#39;ll reorder you. Before we begin, I ask that everyone please be patient as we learn to operate this new system in real time. As a reminder, public comment is limited to the items on today&#39;s agenda. While it remains our strong intent to have public comment regularly included on meeting agendas, the City Council reserves the right to end or eliminate these public comment periods at any point if we deem that this system is being abused or is unsuitable for allowing our meetings to be conducted efficiently and in a manner in which we are able to conduct our necessary business. I will moderate the public comment in the following manner. The public comment period is up to 10 minutes and I will give each speaker two minutes to speak. I will call on each speaker by name and in the order in which they registered on the Council&#39;s website. If you&#39;ve not yet registered and would like to speak, you can go to the Council&#39;s website before the end of this meeting. Sorry, I just lost my place. I want to make sure that we have public comment instructions correct. The public comment link is listed on today&#39;s agenda if you&#39;d like to sign up before the end of public comment. Once I call on a speaker&#39;s name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt if you have been unmuted will be the speaker&#39;s cue that is their turn to speak. When you hear that cue, you have pressed star 6, not pound 6. And once I call on the speaker, please begin by speaking by stating your name and the item in which you are addressing. Speakers will hear a chime. When 10 seconds are left, there will be a lot of time. Once the speaker hears the chime, we ask you please wrap up your public comments. Speakers do not end their public comments at the end of the allotted time. Speakers&#39; microphones will be muted to allow us to call on the next speaker. Once you&#39;ve completed your public comment, we ask you please disconnect from the line. And if you plan to continue following this meeting, please do so via the Seattle Channel or the listening options on the agenda. Please remember that there are separate public hearings for items 1, 3, and 4 relating to manufactured home parks, the West Point Treatment Facility, and the Neighborhood Residential Name Change. If your comments relate to one of those items, please save them for the appropriate public hearing. The public comment period is now open and we will begin with the first speaker on the list. For general public comment, I see Holly Towns, Steve Zempke, Suzanne Grant, and David Haynes. I see Deb Barker for item number 4 and Richard Ellison also for item number 4. Richard Ellison, I&#39;m seeing that you want to talk about the tree protection ordinance. Do you also? So we&#39;ll probably call on you just to see what&#39;s going on there. First three folks up, Holly Towns, Steve Zempke, Suzanne Grant. Holly, good morning. I see you there. Press star 6. Let&#39;s bring Steve Zempke up just to keep us moving. Steve Zempke, you&#39;re up. Press star 6 and Holly Towns will come back to you at the end. Oh, I see Holly&#39;s finally off mute. Steve, hang on just a second. Holly, good morning. Take it away. Holly, you&#39;re off mute now, but you might be on mute on your phone. There we go. One more time, Holly. All right. Let&#39;s move on to Steve Zempke. Holly, if you come off mute, just hang tight until Steve&#39;s done and then we&#39;ll take you up. Steve Zempke, please, star 6. Having trouble with Holly and Steve. Maybe promote Suzanne Grant and let&#39;s just. Suzanne Grant, good morning, star 6. Hello, this is Suzanne. Good morning, Suzanne. Take it away. I&#39;ll take it away. I&#39;m addressing agenda number 6. SDCI, we are wondering why we do not have an ordinance to save our trees. Your words get old as the trees are sold. You&#39;re making lots of money off developer fees. The permits keep on selling. They keep cutting our trees. Have you no conscience? How can you sleep at night? You never look into the future through your children&#39;s eyes. Fires burning hotter. Cities without trees. The climate is changing in our lifetime while you&#39;re telling lies. Knowing the trees you&#39;re cutting down could be saving lives. Stop the stall. End the exemptions. Implement all urban forestry commission recommendations, please. Tree requirements on single family zoned properties, in other words, neighborhood residential properties. Restore them to a minimum of 2 inches of tree caliper for every 1,000 square feet of lot area. And make any mention of tree reduction, any mention of reduction in tree requirements should not they should not it should not be there should always be no tree reductions. Thank you very much. Thank you, Suzanne. Beautiful. I&#39;m looking forward to your next album. Please let me know when it&#39;s coming out and I will be there to get it signed. Holly towns. Good morning. Press star six. And if you&#39;re still having trouble, we can call David Haynes and Steve&#39;s empty. I&#39;m seeing you are not present. So try calling back in if you&#39;re having trouble. Holly, are you able to come off mute? I&#39;m seeing Holly coming off mute. Maybe can you promote David Haynes, Mr. G. David Haynes. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you. Yeah. Good morning. 21st century first world quality housing is what younger generations need. Originally built classic homes of first world quality, robust brilliance are justified to remodel and preserve the house built at 801 16th Avenue on a corner lot with much more traffic since 1909 originally meant for a single family has been patchwork fixed in 1937 as a duplex for the Catholic Church. God knows what they did in there. And again, in 1941 and 1951, all with add ons that had nothing to do with neoclassical quality, only perceptions of wealth then remodeled in 1984. This house violates the integrity and shouldn&#39;t be preserved. The building code violations only touch the surface of how flawed the design is to truly be considered a neoclassical mansion. It&#39;s offensive to the taste and reminder of Seattle&#39;s notorious embellishments and iconic misinterpretation of first world quality. Only thing you&#39;re doing is a favor for a big bank donor, associated speculator and meddling for historical preservation dollars and looking for federal tax haven for owner at expense of future residents about to be shaken down with low quality living due to freaky clapboard housing chopped up into four living areas from one. Seattle only preserves slums as favor to big bank owners and donors of Democrats still cheating the people out of any and all 21st century housing choices. It&#39;s another rental and dilapidated inflated obsolete flawed design causing mental crisis justifying a teardown redevelopment built as one. Perhaps city council should sue to have zero taken off the property value since artificially inflated is abusing housing market. The house sold in 1988 for $194,000. Now Democrats want to help a speculator secure a value of $2.4 million artificially suggested price for middlemen oppressing housing market. Taking zero off property values would be more reasonable to preserve a $240,000 especially when they are lying about it being a neoclassical mansion versus two cheap wooden clapboard pillars to give it a tray chic two bit Seattle stamp of approval. Proving how dishonest Democrats hate help. Thank you. Thank you, David. Always great to hear from you. Appreciate hearing from you this morning. Holly towns. Give it a try one more time. We&#39;ll try more times but you&#39;re able to press star six, it will take you off of not pound six. And if you have a headset in that might be why we couldn&#39;t hear you before. Holly? All right. If we could promote Steve Zempki, I see he was back to present. Steve Zempki, there you are. Star six. Great. Good morning. This is Steve Zempki speaking for tree pack. Hang on real quick. Thanks for resetting the timer. Holly, hang tight just a second. We&#39;re going to let Steve speak for two minutes and then you&#39;re going to go. So okay. I can hear you now. Yeah. I&#39;ll be quiet. Thanks. Good morning, Steve. We&#39;ve reset your timer and please feel free to take it away. Hey, good morning. This is Steve Zempki. I&#39;m chair of tree pack. And I want to say that we as an organization are disappointed in the effort so far to update the current tree protection ordinance. No draft language has been available for public review. And we question how you can do a determination of non-significance without allowing the public to first review a draft and look at the impacts. We urge that the draft be available for not two weeks as usual, but eight months, because this is a very complex issue. We also have concern that we feel that very little outreach was done by SDCI and OSC and reaching people. For instance, they held listening sessions with 29 people and tried to draw conclusions on some major issues like whether or not there should be permits to remove significant trees. Meanwhile, the tree pack along with the Northwest Progressive Institute has sent you previously a poll that we did that showed that we did with 617 people with a 4.3% margin of error and a confidence interval of 95% that said that creating a permitting process for removal of significant trees had a two to one margin, 57% supporting 28% opposing with 15% not sure. Also increasing protection for significant exceptional trees pulled 78% to 13% in opposition and adding replacement requirements for significant exceptional trees pulled 76% to 13%. We think the poll shows the public support out there for this effort and that you need to listen to it. We also want to note that several years ago, two years ago, I guess two and a half years ago, we also did a change.org outreach which had 5,271 people saying you need to act. So please listen to the public and create a strong ordinance. That&#39;s not happening now. Thank you. Thank you, Steve. Always appreciate hearing from you. Holly, good morning. Good morning. Can you hear me? We can. Thank you for your patience. All right. Hi. This is Holly Towns. I&#39;m a member of the 43rd district democrats environmental caucus and active member of shift zero. And I&#39;m calling as you know to support the energy code amendment. But I&#39;m really calling today to speak to you about the need to move ahead more aggressively on addressing climate change in existing buildings which contribute far more greenhouse gases than new buildings. I urge you to start working behind the scenes on how to address the existing buildings. There&#39;s lots of excellent resources and support in our city and people willing to help. There are other cities who are stepping forward now and now it&#39;s time for Seattle. You know, as an engineer, this crisis reminds me of a crack in the bridge, for example, in Magnolia. It is small now and seems insignificant perhaps. But if we don&#39;t address it quickly, it will propagate and propagate faster, increasing in speed and resulting in the collapse of the bridge and a huge disaster both economically and health wise and for the lives of people. This is how the climate is now. And I know and I appreciate how hard you&#39;re working on have and are working on all the challenges in our city and there are many. But I ask you to take the climate crisis much more to heart and start working harder on this issue. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you, Holly, and thank you for your patience. Mr. G, can you confirm we have no further public registrants for public comment? Is that correct? That is correct. However, I may have made a mistake here. Caller number six, I may have misnamed and he is signed up for public comment again, but now I&#39;m lost on the list here. Yes. Well, I may have misnamed the caller. So this may be I&#39;m going to unmute this one and see what happens. Oh, this might have been my. Okay. Is this Richard? Hello. Yes, this is Richard Ellison. Thank you. Good morning. Do you want to do public comment and agenda item four? Oh, lost you there. Hello? We&#39;re back. Yes. I&#39;d like to your machine is doing weird stuff. I&#39;d like to comment on both number six and number four. So how do I do that? Hang tight. Hang tight. Number six. We&#39;re going to give you two minutes now and then we&#39;ll call you back for the public hearing. So you&#39;ve got two minutes. Thank you. My name is Richard Ellison and I&#39;d like to comment on the STCI report, the quarterly report, which completely ignored official recommendations by the Seattle City Council&#39;s own urban forest commission&#39;s draft tree protection ordinance. We, by the way, had about 900 positive comments and support. STCI is also ignoring the voting citizens of Seattle who overwhelmingly want greater tree protection of Seattle trees and tree canopy. The quarterly report says the city will not require permits to remove exceptional trees. Few tree protection code items are being considered at this time. This in my mind is the latest scandal of STCI. They claim they are listening sessions of focal groups found the majority did not want thumbs down a simple tree permit removal system, but STCI interviewed only 29 people in total. Yet in contrast to the 2021 polling by NPI, the national, the northwest progressive institute of 617 likely voters who overwhelmingly favored policy to protect and expand Seattle&#39;s tree canopy. 82% agreed and only 11% disagreed that Seattle tree ordinance should be strengthened. Asked about a tree permit system, 57% liked the permit system and only 28% were against permits. So the majority said thumbs up two to one over thumbs down in favor of a permit system. So how did STCI conclude so differently? They give only vague suggestions of how to increase tree protections and yet they claim to have an EIS ready for review this month. Are the trees to be saved? How are they to be saved? You can&#39;t evaluate environmental impact if you don&#39;t know what the exact policies are going to be followed. If you really want to keep the tree canopy in Seattle as a big mitigation for 100 degree summer days and record rainfall winters, then put your foot down and tell STCI to require permits and better tree protection and habitat creating green factors. Hire a city forester, lots of arborists, track tree removal and planting. Thank you, Richard. We&#39;ll have you back up in just a moment. Mr. G, double confirming we have no further registrants for public comment. Is that correct? Affirmative. There are no other public comment registrants. I&#39;ll get it right one day. Thank you, Mr. G. Seeing as we have no additional speakers remotely present, we will move on to the next agenda item. Our first agenda item is council bill 120206, which establishes protection for manufactured home parks. Mr. Ahn, will you please read this item into the record? Short title, please. Agenda item one, council bill 120206, an ordinance relating to land use and zoning, amending the Seattle municipal code and the official land use map to establish a mobile home park overlay district and requesting that the office of housing add the census tract in which the mobile home park overlay district is located to those eligible for the affirmative. Marketing and community preference policy adopted in the housing funding poll. Wonderful. Thank you, Mr. Ahn. As I shared at our briefing on Friday, this legislation establishes long-term protection for manufactured home parks in Seattle. This is the second time it is coming before our committee before we pass it. It has taken us about three years to get us to this point today and again want to recognize council member Juarez for her consistent leadership for her residence in D5. I&#39;m partial to my own district but really like D5 as well. So council member Juarez, great job leading for your district. We have a public hearing today for the committee votes on the legislation. As many of today&#39;s agenda items, I will ask that we suspend the rules to vote on the same day as the public hearing to allow these bills to move to full council before this council term ends, recognizing that each of these bills have been in committee twice. So just want to highlight that for my colleagues. We&#39;re going to ask to suspend the rules on a number of bills today. We have heard them all twice in committee before passage. Before we open the public hearing, Mr. Freeman of council central staff is with us. Mr. Freeman, could you provide us a brief refresher on this legislation? Perhaps I&#39;ll share my screen here and just concentrate on a few of the slides here that the committee looked at last Friday. So council bill 120206, as council member Strauss mentioned, will create a mobile home park overlay district to preserve the city&#39;s two remaining mobile home parks. As the committee is well aware, those two remaining mobile home parks are the Bellaby and the Halcyon. Both are located adjacent to each other in the Crown Hill, sorry, not Crown Hill, Bitter Lake residential urban village. In terms of the regulations themselves, the current bill, council bill 120206, flows from a settlement agreement with the owner of the Bellaby and makes some changes to the bill that the council was considering back in the summer, council bill 1202079. The proposed overlay district would limit residential uses to mobile homes, mobile home parks, and low-income housing on sites owned by a government nonprofit or religious organization, require relocation assistance, write a first offer and rent limitations specific to current residents when low-income housing is developed on a current mobile home park site, allow some commercial uses but limit the size of those uses so that they&#39;re less likely to be developed on a mobile home park site, remove some setback density limits and amenity area requirements that were in the prior proposal. So instead, the current regulations that apply to mobile home parks that are actually in the building code would regulate mobile home park redevelopment. Affirm current C155M zoning, which is the zone designation put in place through the MHA citywide up zones, and establish the city&#39;s intent to periodically revisit the overlay district and finally provide for expiration of the overlay district in approximately 30 years by January 1st, 2051. So that, in a nutshell, is what Council Bill 120206 would do. Also, as the committee will recall, on Monday, the full council voted to extend the current mobile home park, the moratorium on redevelopment of mobile home parks. That moratorium would expire on the earlier of the effective date of this council bill, Council Bill 120206, or six months, whichever is earlier. So assuming that this bill passes full council on Monday, it would become effective in late January and the mobile home park moratorium, the redevelopment, the moratorium on redevelopment would lift at that time. So that is a refresher on CB120206. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions that you might have now or at the end of the public hearing. Thank you, Mr. Freeman. I do have a few questions and colleagues. If you have questions, please come off camera or on camera. First question, Mr. Freeman, I&#39;ve heard some questions from the community members about why any non-residential uses would be allowed under the overlay district. Can you explain why some commercial uses were included? Sure. And a lot of the sort of the structure of the bill, what&#39;s allowed in the overlay, what&#39;s not allowed, limitations on sort of current uses that might otherwise be allowed absent the overlay have to do with the contours of land use law. But essentially, what this bill tries to do is to make mobile home parks a continuing highest and best use of the land. And it does that by limiting the non-residential uses that could occur on the current zoning to make them less likely to occur so that a mobile home park is a preferable use while the overlay district is in place. So the current zoning, that&#39;s kind of a framing description. And now to the specific question about non-residential uses, because the current zoning is C-155 and has been commercial prior to the MHA up zone, we have to allow some commercial uses so that an owner who has some reasonable investment expectation that they could use the site for commercial uses could preserve that and could still try to meet that expectation. However, it&#39;s a lot less likely that a developer, that a current owner or future developer would develop the sites with commercial uses because the intensity of the uses and the range of uses is less than what would otherwise be allowed in the commercial 155 zone. So absent the overlay, somebody could develop a commercial use on either or both sites to an FAR, so to a sort of a density of 3.5. So you can imagine approximately a four-story building lot line to lot line on both sites. Under the overlay, the allowed floor area ratio is significantly less. It&#39;s just two for commercial uses. Moreover, there&#39;s a maximum size limit for commercial uses of 5,000 square feet. So that means that somebody seeking to develop a commercial use on the site would be limited to a building of about 5,000 square feet. And they could not, if they wanted to put multiple 5,000 square foot buildings on the site, they would have to phase that over multiple years. So there&#39;d be a significant transaction cost involved in that. So just to be clear, the overlay doesn&#39;t preclude somebody redeveloping the sites with commercial uses. The only way the city could provide a guarantee that that would not happen is if the city actually acquired the sites. However, it makes it much less likely that commercial uses will be developed. Thank you. And so just to, I know that there are some good protections and parameters in this bill to ensure that if the space is redeveloped, that affordable housing is the most prominent option to move forward with. So put another way about commercial uses in this, if we did not allow for the commercial uses, then affordable housing that built, you know, a tower of affordable housing could not have a coffee shop on the first floor. Is that correct? No, somebody could have a coffee shop on the, so let&#39;s say that a site or a portion of one of the mobile home park sites is redeveloped with affordable housing, which wouldn&#39;t be allowed under the overlay district. The primary use would have to be, the principal use would have to be a residential use. That residential use could be in a mixed use building that has some modest commercial components to it, like a coffee shop that you&#39;re describing or potentially some other institutional use or something like that. But it would not have, for example, it would be less likely to have, for example, on the ground floor, a Walmart or other sort of big box retailer. Wonderful. That&#39;s very helpful. And under this legislation, can you share what other safeguards would be in place to prevent a developer from tearing down homes and using the property for a non-residential use or a Walmart? Yeah, I think sort of the one is just a limitation on the types of uses that are allowed. So the principal uses that are allowed under the overlay district would be mobile home parks and mobile homes and affordable housing developed by a non-profit or governmental entity. So that&#39;s sort of the primary thing. Another sort of limitation that tips the scales in favor of continued mobile home park use is the size that a commercial use could be developed to. It wouldn&#39;t be able to be developed to the full FAR that&#39;s allowed in the underlying zone. And there&#39;s a maximum size limit per establishment essentially. So that&#39;s another safeguard. A third safeguard has to do with phasing of development. So somebody could not come in, subdivide the parcel, and have separate 5,000 square foot buildings on multiple subdivided lots within the mobile home park with one permit activity. They would have to do it over a series of years if that was their objective, which would add cost and time to the development process, which makes it again less likely that that kind of commercial development could occur. Very helpful. Very helpful. Different question here. There&#39;s been some confusion about the median income levels in the legislation. Can you clarify how AMI works and confirm the AMI levels in the legislation? They are maximums, correct? Yeah, they are maximums. And the reason the city uses median income as opposed to, say, average income or something like that is that for incomes particularly, averages always skew much higher. So somebody can&#39;t make less than $0 a year, but somebody can make millions of dollars a year. And so the reason that the city and HUD and other affordable housing developers use median income is to adjust for the fact that averages always skew higher, especially when it comes to income. The maximum affordability level here is about 60% of AMI. I don&#39;t actually have the city&#39;s scaled income charts in front of me right now, but my recollection is that the median income in the city of Seattle is about $100,000 a year for a two-person household, I think, these days. So a qualifying household could earn no more than $60,000 a year. There are a couple of specific protections in here for the current mobile home park residents. So for those residents who exercise a rider-first offer and choose to come back to an affordable housing development that might be developed at some point in the future on these sites, they would pay no more than 40% of AMI or 30% of their current income.
So if somebody&#39;s earning less than 40% of their median income, they would not have to pay up to 40% of AMI. And that is a provision that is unique to the current mobile home park residents. That wouldn&#39;t be true of folks who might live in an affordable housing development that&#39;s developed on the site in the future who were not residents of the mobile home parks. Thank you. Very, very helpful. And last question here. Can you elaborate on the height limits proposed in this bill? Sure. So the underlying zoning is C-155M. So the maximum height for commercial development under the current zoning is 55 feet. So somebody could build an approximately five or six-story building on the site. So with the overlay, there are more restrictive development standards. So the underlying zoning does not apply. The more restrictive zoning in the overlay would apply to future development. And for that, there just has to be some physical development standards to guide what development might look like. As I said earlier, the intent of the bill is to make it more likely that mobile home parks remain the highest and best use of the property. Mobile home parks, obviously, are not 30 feet in height, which is the maximum height for residential uses. We don&#39;t know what future innovations there might be in development of structures that meet the definition of a manufactured home in the land use code. So consequently, we want to apply some kind of limitation there so that in the future, if there is something unanticipated, we&#39;ll at least have some way of regulating it, hence the 30-foot height limit for residential uses. The 40-foot height limit for commercial uses, this is, again, less than what would otherwise be allowed under current zoning. And it&#39;s also intended to sort of make it less likely that somebody might choose to develop a commercial structure on either of the mobile home park sites. If somebody did choose to do that, there would be a height limit. That height limit would be 40 feet, so about 15 feet less than they would otherwise be allowed to develop under current zoning. Very helpful. Thank you. Colleagues, any other questions? I know we have had this bill back before so many times. Council Member Juarez, please. I just have to clear up a few things based on some of the correspondence and information that I received from our district director, Dean Alsop, who has been meeting with the residents at the Bellabee and Halcyon for quite a while. So, Keela, I know that we know the language and how a lot of this works, so I&#39;m going to ask you just to slow down a little bit. There are two things, actually three things, and I&#39;ll just ask you, we got to start with the premise that this is private property. It&#39;s not government property. So, the government just can&#39;t tell a private property owner what to do there. Obviously, we have zoning laws and all those other uses. And what evolved from all of this is an agreement between the property owners so we can ensure that the people that are living there, that are elderly or low income, can stay there. And then if they build it up, they can come back. Some of the confusion with some of our elderly relatives are that they don&#39;t quite understand AMI. And if you could just explain AMI, kind of its origins, and why the state and federal government kind of use that as a yardstick to determine housing. It&#39;s not the perfect yardstick, but it&#39;s the one we have, just like the definition for poverty. It&#39;s pretty bad, but it&#39;s the one we start with. Because I think the people that are watching from the residential homes, that&#39;s where they&#39;re stuck. And the second part is why it&#39;s not a spot zone, why there are allowed other uses, because if there weren&#39;t, then it would be a spot zone, and that would be illegal. So if we could just kind of clear that up, maybe in a little more layman terms for our relatives that are listening. Thank you. Yeah, maybe I&#39;ll start with maybe a definition of what median is. And I think some people hear median and assume it means average, and they&#39;re actually very different things. So the median is just the midpoint in a range. So in the range of folks, of incomes in the city of Seattle, at the very bottom end there might be zero dollars, and at the very high end there might be many millions of dollars. So a median is the midpoint in that range of incomes in the city. As I said earlier, the reason the city doesn&#39;t use average, and the reason that HUD doesn&#39;t use average, the state of Washington doesn&#39;t use average, is that average with incomes always skew higher. So a person can&#39;t make less than zero dollars, but there are many people out there, especially in Seattle these days, who are making much more than half a million dollars a year. And so if the city were to use something like average, the qualifying income would inevitably skew higher than the midpoint. So that&#39;s the reason the city uses median. And HUD promulgates rent levels that the city uses that are based on household size. So median income is scaled by household size. So you can imagine, say, a one-person household, there&#39;s only one income earner in that household. A median income for that household is going to be different than a two-person household, or a three-person household, or a four-person household. So there&#39;s sort of a scaling of affordability that is based on the household size. And all that information comes from surveys that are conducted by the federal government and the state, including the census. So that, I think, answers, hopefully answers the question about maybe demystifies what median is. And I&#39;m happy to, I don&#39;t think I can just on the fly pull up the Office of Housing link, because I always have to search for it for many minutes. Otherwise, I would try to do that. I&#39;m just trying to make sure that our relatives who live there understand, because that&#39;s been kind of a point where Dean has tried really hard, and I know Noah has too, to make sure that they understand how this deal came together. Is it fair to say that this is, I don&#39;t want to go be too dramatic if it&#39;s historic, but I don&#39;t know where we&#39;ve had these type of agreements with a manufactured mobile home park in the city of Seattle. The last one they actually sold, the one in Lake City, they sold it and they built housing there. But this one we saved. This one, and yeah, and just to be clear about who the settlement agreement is with, it&#39;s not actually with both owners. It was the settlement agreement was with the Bella Bee owner, but it informs, and it&#39;s, there&#39;s, you know, that informs this current iteration of the bill. But that&#39;s, but the settlement agreement was largely about the State Environmental Policy Act appeal. And so while the settlement agreement informs this version of the bill, this is something that is up for consideration and could be modified. But the, in terms of the history of mobile home parks in the city, I&#39;m not aware of any other settlement agreements that resulted in a change to regulation. There is certainly a rich history of the city struggling with how to preserve mobile home parks. There was the recent redevelopment of the mobile home park that you&#39;re talking about, that&#39;s just off Lake City Way, I think also in your district. But in the 90s and 80s, there were moratoria like we are, like the city has now, a redevelopment of mobile home parks. And some of those, some of that elevation of the issue from redevelopment, from the threat of redevelopment of mobile home parks led to changes to Title 22, which is the primary regulatory portion of the Seattle Municipal Code when it comes to mobile home parks. And there are extended notice periods and a requirement of submission of a redevelopment plan, stuff that actually largely mirrors state law but has some city additions to it as well. Thank you, Kito, that&#39;s very helpful. Just confirming Council Member Juarez, no further questions. Seeing none, great. Colleagues, any other questions? Not seeing any at this time, and so I want to now bring us up to opening the public hearing. And again, Mr. Freeman, thank you for those clarifications, the AMI especially, the average versus the median is very helpful. Before we begin, before we open the remote public hearing, I would again ask that everyone please be patient as we continue to learn to operate this new system in real time and navigate through an inevitable growing pains. We are continuously looking for ways to fine-tune this process and adding new features that allow for additional means of public participation in our Council meetings. I will moderate the public hearing in the following manner. Each speaker will be given two minutes to speak. I&#39;ll be calling one speaker at a time and in the order in which you registered on the Council&#39;s website. If you have not yet registered and would like to speak, you can sign up before the end of this public hearing by going to the Council&#39;s website, seattle.gov forward slash council. The link is also on today&#39;s agenda. Once I call on speaker&#39;s name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and automatic prompt if you&#39;ve been unmuted will be the speaker&#39;s cue that it is their turn to speak. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item that you are addressing as a reminder public comment must relate to Council Bill 120206 regarding manufactured home parks. If you have comments about something that is not on today&#39;s agenda or another public hearing, you can always provide written comments by emailing my office dan.straus at seattle.gov. Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of the allotted time. Once you hear the chime, we ask you begin to wrap up your public comment, your comments at the end of the allotted time provided and the speaker&#39;s microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next speaker. Once you&#39;ve completed your public comment, we ask you please disconnect from the line and if you plan to continue please follow the meeting, please do so via seattle channel or the listening options on the agenda. With that the public hearing on Council Bill 120206 is now open. We will begin with the first and only speaker on the list which is Linda McCoy. She is not present. Linda, I want to make sure if you are listening you received a confirmation email from sign up which has a different phone number than the listen line and so I want to make sure that you have called into the correct phone number and not the listen line. Shoot, did I realize that she was not present? We would have to do some of this a moment earlier but I do believe we heard from Linda McCoy last Friday when this came before our committee public hearing. Linda, I know that you have emailed us, we have received your emails and we&#39;re happy to include those in the record of this public hearing. I&#39;m going to stall for just another minute to see if Linda is calling into the hearing wire. Linda, unfortunately I am seeing you as listed as not present for the public hearing. We will include the emails that you have sent in the record of the public hearing. Mr. G, can you confirm, Council Member Juarez, would you like me to wait another minute? Do you want to call Dean and have him call Linda? Mr. Chair, thank you so much for being sensitive to that. We have been working really closely with Linda and we have been meeting with her. I was hoping we would hear from her because we are trying to ask some of the questions that have been teed up from her and her concerns. I&#39;m getting a text now. I&#39;m not seeing and I feel bad because Linda is amazing and so is Patty and some of the other elders that we&#39;ve been working with. I know that we have her comments and our conversations in her letters and emails. We&#39;ve got Linda McCoy present. Nice work, Council Member Juarez. We&#39;re magic. Nice work, Dean. Linda, hi. At your convenience, press star six and you&#39;ll come off of mute. There you are. We can&#39;t hear you though, so either you might be muted on your own. Oh, we can hear you. Here you are, Linda. Good morning. Good morning. I just want to thank you for all your... Can you hear me? Yes, we can, Linda. Noah, can you reset the timer? Linda, you&#39;ve got two minutes. Take it away whenever you... Oh, you went on mute again. There you are, off mute. Whenever you want, you can start. We can hear you and you can start whenever you want. Okay, great. Thank you. So, I want to thank the committee for working... Oh, dear. That was what I said earlier. Noah, can you restart the timer? We don&#39;t. Yeah. Oh, dear. Don&#39;t worry, Linda. We&#39;re going to be patient with you. Whenever you are ready, you can go, but don&#39;t feel any pressure. Jump early. Can you hear me? Yeah, we can hear you. Okay. Yeah. I&#39;m so sorry. This is Linda McCoy. I&#39;m on now. Can you hear me? Yep, we can hear you. Someone&#39;s saying they can hear me. Yes, I can hear you. Okay, good. I&#39;m so sorry. Okay. So, yes, thank you to the committee for working so hard on this, and I know that there&#39;s so many details that... I&#39;m going to move over, so I&#39;m out of range of my computer because I&#39;m getting feedback. So, I appreciate the explanations of things in the bill, and I need to move even further away. There we go. And I do know that it&#39;s been a long time, a long haul, but I also... I just want to put in a last-minute plug for making sure things are consistent, and if a renegotiation needs to occur, then it will have to occur. But I also do think that this is better than what we have now, which is no protections. So, in that sense, I do support this passing if you find that you really can&#39;t figure out a way to make any of the changes that we had suggested, and we do just need to go ahead. So, that&#39;s a final comment I wanted to make. So, thank you so much, and I hope this somehow successfully got entered. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Linda. We got it all, and I really appreciate your patience with us with the technological issues. Okay. Bye. Bye. Have a great day. Mr. G, confirming there are no further public hearing registrants present. Is that correct? Affirmative. There are no further public hearing registrants. Thank you. Glad that I finally got that right. So, with that, the public hearing on Council Bill 120206 is now closed, as that was the last speaker remotely present to speak. Thank you to everyone who provided comment today. Colleagues, I would like to suspend the rules. So, I&#39;m going to ask us to suspend the rules to allow us to vote on the same day as a public hearing so that we can adopt this legislation before the end of the year. I want to double-check, are there any questions before we vote on suspending the rules? Just, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re going to get to this, Council Member Strauss, but just as a reminder, there is an amendment to sort of, this is actually a good suggestion from Ms. McCoy, to correct an error in the recitals and to also sort of true up the legislative history by adding a recital that reflects the Council&#39;s recent action on December 6th. I am very excited to bring the Linda McCoy amendment forward. We do need to move the bill first, and to move the bill, we have to suspend the rules. So, we are seconds away. Just want to thank you for that reminder, Mr. Freeman. Any, seeing no questions, I move to suspend the rules to allow a vote on Council Bill 120206 on the same day as the public hearing. Is there a second? Second. It has been moved and seconded to suspend the rules to allow a vote on the same day as a public hearing. Will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Juarez? Yes. Council Member Menendez? Yes. Council Member Strauss? Yes. Five in favor, none opposed. Thank you. The motion to suspend the rules to vote on the same day as a public hearing carries. There is, as Mr. Freeman mentioned, there is one amendment before us today, the update, to update recitals to reflect the legislative history. Before we get to the amendment, I will move the underlying legislation. So, I&#39;d like to move to recommend passage of Council Bill 120206. Is there a second? Second. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. This, the one amendment before us was championed by Council Member Juarez and brought to, suggested by Linda McCoy of the Halcyon Manufactured Home Park Homeowners Association. It would update a recital that describes the legislative history to reflect that, since this bill was initially drafted, the moratorium on the redevelopment of the manufactured home parks has been renewed twice. I just want to double check, Mr. Freeman, have I missed anything with the amendment? No, it updates, you got it, Council Member Strauss. It correctly reflects the number of times the moratorium has been extended, that&#39;s four additional times, and it also reflects the Council&#39;s most recent action on December 6th, which extends the moratorium, assuming that the bill is approved by the Mayor for an additional six-month period or the earlier of the effective date of Council Bill 120206. Great. So, I&#39;d like to, thank you, I would like to move to amend Council Bill 120206 as shown in Amendment 1 on the agenda. Second. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded to amend Council Bill 120206 as shown in Amendment 1 on the agenda. Will the clerk please call the roll? Yes. Council Member Lewis. Yes. Council Member Juarez. Aye. Council Member Mosqueda. Aye. Chair Strauss. Yes. Five in favor, none opposed. Thank you. The motion to amend Council Bill 120206 as shown in Amendment 1 carries. We can now move on to vote on the underlying legislation. I do want to check to see if colleagues have questions or comments. I will just say that, and I shared this last week, that my grandparents lived in a manufactured home park where they were able to own the manufactured home but not the land under them, and it was always very front and center in my family&#39;s mind that if that land was was sold, the manufactured home would have to be moved, but the manufactured home was old enough that it would not have survived the move. So this is an interesting gray area and private property, and as Mr. Freeman mentioned, there&#39;s already a manufactured home park in Lake City that is no longer there. So just taking this moment to thank Council Member Juarez for your leadership to bring this legislation forward throughout the number of moratoriums and to get us to today and keeping us out of court because you&#39;re a lawyer and good at it. With that, any other thoughts? Seeing none, I&#39;d like to now move to vote on the legislation. So I would like to move to recommend passage of Council Bill 120206 as amended. Is there a second? Second. It has been moved and seconded to recommend passage of Council Bill 120206 as amended. Will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Juarez? Aye. Council Member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Strauss? Yes. Five in favor. Thank you. The Council Bill 120206 as amended carries. The motion carries. Thank you all. The legislation will be before the full Council on Monday, December 13th for a final vote. Our next agenda item is Council Bill 120239, which updates the energy code based on some unresolved issues from the energy code update at the start of the year. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the abbreviated title into the record? Item 2, Council Bill 120239, an ordinance relating to Seattle&#39;s construction codes, amending the 2018 Seattle energy code. Thank you, Council Member Lewis. As the prime sponsor of the legislation, would you like to share anything before we begin? Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciated the opportunity to have a public hearing on this legislation last Friday to get this rolling and wrapped up by the end of this year. In the interim, my office did coordinate with Yolanda and your office, Mr. Chair, to set a date certain amendment that we will consider. So with that, I can hold the rest of my comments until consideration of the bill itself, resting on our discussion from the hearing on Friday. And I&#39;ll have some questions for Yolanda regarding the amendments and then some closing remarks before we do a vote on the legislation. Thank you, Council Member Lewis. We are joined by Yolanda Ho of Council Central SAFA, as well as Duane Johnlin and Micah Chappell of SDCI to answer any questions. Yolanda, we had a really great briefing last time. We&#39;ve got a packed agenda this time, so I will ask for a brief refresher, but I will just highlight that the last meeting we had was very comprehensive, so thank you for that. Anything that you&#39;d like to share before we vote? Yes, Yolanda Ho, Council Central staff, and as you noted, we have my colleagues from the Seattle Department of Construction Inspections here for any technical questions. Just wanted to do a quick recap of the legislation so that everyone remembers what we are discussing here, that the Council Bill 120239 would amend the 2018 Energy Code, which was adopted by Council in February of this year and went into effect on March 15th. The city has a standard practice of an amended version of the Washington State Energy Code that requires new multifamily residential buildings taller than three stories and all new commercial buildings to conform to higher standards than those required by the state. The regulations also applied alterations and or replacement of existing building components. The 2018 Energy Code included new restrictions on the use of fossil fuels and electric resistance for space and water heating. Water heating restrictions were limited to multifamily and hotel uses based on their more predictable water usage. The committee considered amending the 2018 Energy Code in February to extend this restriction to all commercial buildings during the deliberations, but instead requested that the Seattle Department of Construction Inspections conduct additional work on the proposal due to a variety of complicating factors that made it infeasible for the committee to take action on the amendment at that time. This legislation is the result of that requested work. It would require that all new commercial buildings use electric heat pump water heaters with some exceptions that were recommended by the Construction Codes Advisory Board, which is an independent advisory board for the city regarding amendments to the city&#39;s construction codes. Most notably, one exception was made for that it does not apply to upgrades of existing commercial buildings, and it also included some technical and clarifying amendments to support implementation. With that brief summary, I will be happy to entertain questions or have my colleagues from the department answer. Great. Duane, I see you&#39;ve come off mute. Anything you&#39;d like to share? Nope. Great. Colleagues, any questions for Yolanda? We had a really robust conversation last week. Seeing none, and colleagues, as you recall, that on Friday there were discussions of setting a date certain, as Council Member Lewis mentioned, for implementation of these new requirements rather than the usual 30 days after the Mayor signs the legislation. This date certain will allow city departments to conduct outreach and ensure that contractors are aware of the new requirements and give the public a reliable date on which to rely upon, knowing that these new requirements will take effect. After consulting with the SDCI, labor stakeholders, and an implementation date of April 1st was agreed upon. Council Member Lewis and I have an amendment that would add April 1st to the implementation date again, I guess. So we&#39;re going to move the base legislation, and then we&#39;ll move the amendment. Council Member Lewis, do you want to? We&#39;ll wait until then. So if there&#39;s no further discussion, I will move the legislation and then the amendment. So I move to recommend passage of Council Bill 120239. Is there a second? Second. Thank you. I move to amend with... It&#39;s been moved and seconded, and now I would like to move to amend Council Bill 120239 as shown in Amendment 1 on the agenda. Is there a second? Second. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded to amend Council Bill 120239 as shown in Amendment 1. Council Member Lewis, would you like to speak to this? Yes, thank you, Chair Strauss. I think just for our due diligence in this discussion of the amendment, and just to talk briefly about the significance of setting a date certain, maybe give Yolanda a chance to kind of do an overview of the practical impact of the amendment, and then I could ask a few follow-up questions based on Yolanda&#39;s brief overview of the amendment. So the amendment... So without the amendment, the legislation would go into effect somewhere in mid-late January, depending on the mayor&#39;s... Assuming the council passes the legislation on December 13th, and then it gets sent over to the mayor&#39;s office for a signature or a non-signature, and assuming that the mayor allows it to go into effect, it would... I estimate it somewhere around January 22nd, so that would be quite soon. The amendment then kind of pushes this effective date out to April 1st, allowing the Seattle Department of Constructions and Inspections to conduct outreach, as described by the Chair, and let everyone know that this is happening, versus kind of... Especially around the timing with the holidays and everything, so there is more time... It should be ample time to allow for that outreach, so that is the effect of this amendment. Thank you. Chair, I think that overview is sufficient to explain the underlying merits of having a date certain set relative to what the current effective date would be, given when we&#39;re passing the bill, so I don&#39;t have any other questions about the date certain, but once we amend it and we&#39;re looking at final passage, I might ask a few more clarifying things if you want to, but I think this satisfies my question on the date certain amendment. Great. So if there are no further questions, it has been moved and seconded to amend Council Bill 120239, as shown in Amendment 1 on the agenda. Mr. Ahn, can you please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Juarez? Aye. Council Member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Strauss? Yes. Five in favor, none opposed. Thanks. Amendment 1 to Council Bill 120239 carries. The motion carries. Council Member Lewis or colleagues, any other questions or comments before we vote on the legislation as amended? Yes, Mr. Chair. I do actually, I have one question from reviewing the legislation in anticipation of this hearing that I did want to ask Yolanda, just because I don&#39;t know if we covered this in our hearing on Friday, but the practical impact of the significant alterations clause that is in the legislation, and Yolanda, if maybe you could explain a little bit about what the significant alterations clause is, and then also the impact that this particular component would have on new development is an area that I don&#39;t think we addressed on Friday. I might want to turn to my colleague, Dwayne, to pitch in on this one. I don&#39;t know if you Dwayne, to pitch in on this one. I think we did discuss that this legislation does not impact if there is a replacement of equipment in an existing building. This applies to new commercial buildings, but I think I&#39;ll let Dwayne. Dwayne. Could you please state exactly what is the question and what part of the amendment you&#39;re referring to? This is referring, Dwayne, to the underlying bill talking about the significant alterations clause. So this is something I&#39;ve received a couple of inquiries about over the last week and just an overview of the implications and the impact of that is something some folks have reached out about. You&#39;re talking about the underlying code or something in this current amendment that we&#39;re making here? Because I&#39;m still not completely sure what it is that you&#39;re asking. Right. So it&#39;s the practical scope of work that would trigger the need for compliance with this new code under the significant alterations clause. So that is what I&#39;m saying. Yeah. Substantial alterations is typically a point in Seattle Code where we consider it almost a new building.
This is often a complete gut and remodel of an existing building and it&#39;s defined typically as substantially extending the physical or economic life of the building. So it&#39;s a very big deal. And in those situations, we do require that the water heating be brought up to code. The water heating be brought up to code. What we&#39;ve exempted though elsewhere in it is your more typical situation where the water heater has gone out or they just want to replace it and it&#39;s a gas water heater. We&#39;re still allowing that for the time being. Thank you. I think that that really gets to the crux of some of the concern I&#39;ve heard from people about how this might influence significant alteration versus new build. And I think that that&#39;s going to go a long way to assuaging some of the concerns that we&#39;ve heard. So I appreciate you clarifying that. Certainly. Thank you, Duane. And thank you to Joel also for joining us. Thank you, Duane. And thank you to Joel also for joining us last week understanding this is a compromise in some legislation. Colleagues, any other questions before we move forward? There is no further discussion on the legislation as amended. I would like to move recommended passage of Council Bill 120239 as amended. Is there a second? Second. It has been moved and seconded to recommend passage of Council Bill 120239 as amended. Will the clerk please call the roll? Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Juarez? Yes. Council Member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Strass? Yes. Five in favor, none opposed. Thank you. The motion carries. Council Bill 120239 as amended passes. Thank you all. This legislation will be before the full Council on Monday, December 13th for a final vote. Our next agenda item is Council Bill 120215, which allows certain development standards to be waived for the West Point Treatment Facility. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the abbreviated title into the record? Item 3, Council Bill 120215, an ordinance relating to land use review decision procedures amending the Seattle Municipal Code to authorize the director of the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections to administratively waive development standards for minor expansion of sewage treatment plants subject to a Department of Ecology corrective order. Thank you. I took a sip of my coffee just as you finished. Last week in committee, we heard from the leadership of King County Waste Treatment Division about the importance for allowing this work to move forward. We are joined again today by Mr. Freeman of Council Central staff. Mr. Freeman, could you provide us a brief refresher on this legislation that will allow for a 55-foot building in a neighborhood residential zone that is a park on a graded slope that no one can see the building from the park? All right. So, just by way of a reminder, last Friday, Bruce Kessler from King County&#39;s Wastewater Treatment Division walked the committee through the background, sort of what gives rise to this proposed amendment to the land use code. This bill would modify applicable land use procedures to create a limited exception for an expansion of King County&#39;s West Point Treatment Plant. Specifically, it would categorize the proposed expansion as minor when that expansion is below current size limits for minor expansions. That&#39;s 10% of site area. Again, the site here is very large, so we believe the proposed expansion that would accomplish this would be within that size limit, and a qualification is that the development has to be required by our Department of Ecology in order for corrective action. It would authorize the Seattle Department of Construction, the director of STCI, to waive physical development standards. Here, the likely physical development standard to be waived would be height as a Type 1 non-appealable decision, provided that the waiver is the least necessary to achieve the corrective action identified by King County. It would require a construction management plan to mitigate any potential construction impacts, so it&#39;s unclear whether there will be any construction impacts from this. It&#39;s possible and perhaps likely that King County will be able to accommodate most of the construction and staging, etc., on site, but as we all know, West Point is located in a public park, and so the construction management plan is intended to mitigate any potential impacts that might flow. It would make some procedural changes to allow King County to apply for a building permit prior to receiving any waivers from the City, and finally, it would declare a State Environmental Policy Act emergency to exempt both this Council Bill 120215 from review pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act and also a project-level review by STCI. What I should have started with is just a reminder about what the problem is that this legislation seeks to solve, and Bruce Kessler did a good job describing that yesterday on Friday, but just by way of a reminder, the purpose here is to facilitate construction of a building to house an online uninterruptible power supply, so essentially a large building with batteries inside of it, to allow – to facilitate construction of that building sooner than might otherwise be able to occur under typical permit processes. That, in turn, reduces the probability of bypass events because the building could be constructed sooner. So, hopefully that&#39;s a good enough refresher. There&#39;s, of course, the PowerPoint presentation from King County that was provided at last Friday&#39;s committee meeting. Thank you, Mr. Freeman. Councilmember Peterson, please, Chair of the Utilities Committee. Thank you, Chair Strauss, and this is a real good example of different city departments working together, the city working with King County council committees working together to get this done. The power sags that have occurred at the wastewater treatment facility there, West Point, have been an ongoing issue, and Seattle City Light has been working hard with King County Wastewater Division, Seattle Public Utilities is involved. We all want to see a reduction in unnecessary flows that haven&#39;t been treated, especially during storm events and electricity outages. And so this – there were several ways to do this, and this – I really want to compliment central staff, Keto Freeman in particular, for coming up with a solution here and being very thorough about it, and want to thank Chair Strauss for shepherding it through his committee. You know, it really helped to have that special meeting last week so that we could hear it twice and get it done before the end of the year, and then it&#39;s really up to King County to take it from here and to get it done. So just gratitude all around to serve this basic problem of treating our wastewater before it gets into our waterways. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Peterson, Chair of the Utilities Committee, just highlighting the fact that this building that we are providing an exemption for will create an uninterruptible power source to ensure that those power sags don&#39;t happen so that we don&#39;t dump raw sewage in our beautiful Puget Sound. Colleagues, any other questions? And I&#39;m seeing none for Linda. Since I don&#39;t have anyone present, do I need to read the instructions for the public hearing, or can I just open and close it? Councilmember Strauss, you should probably read the instructions in case somebody was not there earlier on in the meeting. Okay. Thank you. And Councilmember – Vice Chair Mosqueda, I do see you are off mute, just as a warning. Okay. Would you like to use – Oh, no, go ahead. Yesterday we didn&#39;t have anybody there either, and I defer to the clerks. Great. Thank you, Vice Chair. I will moderate the public hearing in the following manner. Each speaker will be given two minutes to speak. I will call on one speaker at a time, and in the order in which you register on the Council&#39;s website, if you have not yet registered to speak but would like to, you can sign up before the end of this public hearing by going to the Council&#39;s website at seattle.gov slash council. This link is also on today&#39;s agenda. Once I call a speaker&#39;s name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and automatic prompt. If you have been unmuted, it will be the speaker&#39;s cue. It is their turn to speak. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item that you are addressing as a reminder. Public comment should relate to Council Bill 120215. If you have comments about something that is not on today&#39;s agenda, you can always provide written comments by emailing my office. Speakers will hear a chime. When 10 seconds are left of the allotted time, once you hear the chime, we ask that you begin to wrap up public comments. Speakers do not end their comments by the end of the allotted time provided the speaker&#39;s microphone will be muted to let us call on the next speaker. Once you&#39;ve completed your public comment, we ask you please disconnect from the line. If you plan to continue following this meeting, please do so via the Seattle Channel or the listening options on the agenda. The public hearing on Council Bill 120215 is now open, and we will begin with the first speaker on the list. Mr. Gee, can you please confirm that there are no public hearing registrants currently present to speak at this public hearing? Affirmative. There are no public hearing registrants. Thank you, Mr. Gee. At this time, I do not have anyone remotely present to speak. You&#39;ve already confirmed that there is not a member of the public in the queue before closing this meeting, and so the public hearing on Council Bill 120215 is now closed. We are now moving on. Colleagues, at the beginning of this committee, I noted that I would request that you suspend the rules because we&#39;ve had these items in committee twice. So, colleagues, I will now ask that we suspend the rules to allow us to vote on the same day as the public hearing so that we can adopt this legislation before the end of the year. Any questions before we vote? Seeing none, I move to suspend the rules to allow us to vote on Council Bill 120215 on the same day as the public hearing. Is there a second? Second. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded to suspend the rules to allow us to vote on the same day as the public hearing. Will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Juarez? Aye. Council Member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Strauss? Yes. Five in favor and none opposed. Thank you. The motion to suspend the rules to allow a vote on the same day of the public hearing carries. Colleagues, is there any further discussion before we vote on the underlying legislation? Council Member Peterson, take it away. Thank you, Chair Strauss. In my remarks, I wanted to also thank Council Member Lewis. This is in his district, and early on, he recognized the need to do this. I know King County did a lot of outreach in the community about this as well. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Peterson. Any other comments? Seeing as there&#39;s no further discussion before we will now vote on the underlying legislation, I move to recommend passage of Council Bill 120215. Is there a second? Second. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded to recommend passage of Council Bill 120215. Will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Aye. Chair Strauss? Aye. Chair Strauss? Aye. I move to recommend passage of Council Bill 120215, will the clerk please call the roll? Council Member Peterson? Yes. Council Member Lewis? Yes. Council Member Juarez? Aye. Council Member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Strauss? Yes. Five in favor, none opposed. Thank you. The motion to pass Council Bill 120215 carries. This, uh, the legislation will be before the full 13th for a final vote. Uh, moving on to our next agenda item, our fourth agenda item is Council Bill 120214, which amends the municipal code to change the name of single-family zones to neighborhood residential zones. Mr. Ahn, will you please read the abbreviated title into the record? Agenda item four, Council Bill 120214, an ordinance relating to land use and zoning, renaming single-family zones to neighborhood residential zones. Thank you. This legislation implements the comprehensive plan amendment that we passed earlier this year by reflecting the change from single-family to neighborhood residential in the municipal code. Again, this is name change only. There are no changes to zoning. We are joined by Lish Whitson of Council Central staff. Mr. Whitson, can you please share a brief refresher before we open public hearing? And if, uh, you have slides to share, I always appreciate, uh, sharing screen in my committee. Thank you kindly. All right. So I will try sharing my screen. Screen. Can you see that? Yes, we can. Great. Um, so this bill is, uh, both lengthy and simple. It changes the names of four zones in the Seattle, throughout the Seattle municipal code. Um, single-family residential 9,600 zones would be renamed to neighborhood residential one. Single-family residential 7,200 would be renamed neighborhood residential two. Single-family residential 5,000 would be named neighborhood residential three. And the residential small lot zone would be named neighborhood residential small lot. Um, it amends multiple sections of the municipal code and the official land use map. Um, almost all references to the existing single-family zones would be changed except in the shoreline code, which requires a special process, including state approval. And, um, those amendments will be made, uh, alongside other shoreline code amendment updates, um, in the future. Um, the legislation includes a 180-day effective date to allow SDCI to, um, the Seattle Department of Construction Inspections to update their materials, the maps, and the code. Um, and the last slide I have just shows the location of these zones. It covers about 60 percent of the city&#39;s land area. Any questions? Thank you, Mr. Whitson. We have had this before us multiple times and multiple in many different fashions, uh, looking around. Colleagues, do you have any questions? Seeing no questions, Mr. Whitson, the question I always have for you is, can you confirm this does not change what is allowed or not allowed in any zone in the city? Correct. The only change is to change the name of the zones. Thank you. That&#39;s great. Um, colleagues, um, Council Member Mosqueda, Vice Chair Mosqueda, do you have something to share at this time or totally okay if not? Yes, um, Mr. Chair, is this an appropriate time to make a few comments about the legislation or should I hold off until? Either now or after the public hearing. Let&#39;s do it afterwards. Great. I&#39;ll open the public hearing now and we&#39;ll keep moving. Um, before we open the remote public hearing, I would again ask that everyone please be patient as we continue to learn to operate this new system in real time and navigate through the inevitable growing pains. We are continuously looking for ways to fine-tune this process and adding new features that allow for additional means of public participation in our Council meetings. I will moderate the public hearing in the following manner. Each speaker will be given two minutes to speak. I will call on one speaker at a time and in the order in which you registered on the Council&#39;s website. If you have not registered to speak and would like to, you can sign up before the end of this public hearing by going to the Council&#39;s website at Seattle.gov forward slash Council. The link is also listed on today&#39;s agenda. The, once you register, you will get a phone number to call in that is not the listen line. Once I call on the speaker&#39;s name, staff will unmute the appropriate microphone and an automatic prompt that you have been unmuted will be the speaker&#39;s cue that it is their turn to speak. At that point, you will need to press star six to unmute yourself, not pound six. Please begin speaking by stating your name and the item you are addressing. As a reminder, public comment should relate to Council Bill 120214. If you have comments about something that is not on today&#39;s agenda or not Council Bill 120214, you can always provide written comment by emailing my office. Speakers will hear a chime when 10 seconds are left of the allotted time. Once you hear the chime, we ask you begin to wrap up your public comment. If speakers do not end their public comments at the end of the allotted time provided, the speaker&#39;s microphone will be muted to allow us to call on the next speaker. Once you have completed your public comment, we ask you please disconnect from the line. And if you plan to continue following this meeting, please do so via the Seattle channel or the listening options listed on the agenda. The public hearing on Council Bill 120214 is now open, and we will begin with the first speaker on the list. I see two people, three people, no, two people present. I see Deb Barker, Deb Barker and Richard Ellison. Deb, good morning. I see you&#39;re already off mute. Good morning. Take it away at your convenience. I don&#39;t know if I want to stay in my seat because it&#39;s so rare that it actually works. Thank you so much for the opportunity to comment today. I&#39;m Deb Barker, a West Seattle resident. I&#39;m speaking in opposition to Council Bill 120214, the name switch bill. And boy, I sure wish I had a tune to go with that. But maybe I&#39;ll think of it by the time I&#39;m done speaking. In its history, the City Council has adopted strong principled procedures for evaluating a myriad of existing and proposed regulations. As you are aware, the comprehensive plan update process is one such respected and acknowledged tool. I firmly believe that the name switch discussion does not belong in today&#39;s vote, but should be conducted fully within the guidelines of the pending comprehensive plan update procedures. The number of impacted properties with associated owners is by far beyond the scope of this bill. And unfortunately, the perception of hoodwinking truly taints today&#39;s vote. Please vote no on Council Bill 124214 and move the name switch discussion to the comprehensive plan update process where it belongs. Thank you very much. Thank you, Deb. Always appreciate hearing from you. And up next is Richard Ellison. Richard, I see you are here. Press star six. There you are. Thank you, Richard. Take it away. Good morning, again. My name is Richard Ellison, and I&#39;d like to talk about the item number six, which is CB120214, which serves no function except as a smoke screen to deregulate building codes, allowing more trees to be removed and less open space to remain for the citizens of Seattle, this being done before changes in City Council and Mayor and basically trying to railroad it through. The changing of the name while the initiative does not change any other aspect of zoning control is a deliberate action to facilitate the reduction of restrictions in development that have allowed single family to retain 70% of Seattle&#39;s tree canopy. How will the tree canopy be saved? You say that changing the wording from single family zone to neighborhood residential is just a linguistic correction, but it&#39;s a sham job trying to remove all protections for trees as low residential, low residential and multi-family have far less open space and green factory requirements. Neighborhood residential is so much simpler name and seemingly so much simpler way to later change and reduce open space and tree protection requirements in all zones. So what is the cost to update all the maps, the zoning codes, et cetera, for it to occur? What a waste of time and money for the city to change the name of the zoning unless it&#39;s a prelude to a much bigger changes to come under the cover of new zoning change. If you want to up zone, get your open space and tree protection act together first. So any zone has lots of open space and trees. Do you want kids to play on planting strips or in yards? Whether it&#39;s a backyard in a single family zone or a multiplex row of houses, there must be open space for people and the trees will find that space to grow there. It&#39;s not just street trees. It&#39;s not just density. It&#39;s livability and the zoning change, the smoke screen, the developer wolf. Thank you very much. Thank you, Richard. And Mr. G, can you confirm there are no further public hearing registrants for council bill 120214? Affirmative. There are no further public hearing registrants. Thank you. That was our last speaker remotely present to speak at this public hearing. Public hearing on council bill 120214 is now closed. Thank you to everyone who provided comments today. Colleagues, again, for the final time today, I will ask us to suspend the rules to allow us to vote on the same day as a public hearing because we have had this bill in committee twice so that we can adopt this legislation before the end of the year. Any questions before we vote? We will then move the we&#39;ll move the legislation and then council member most data and colleagues will be able to speak. Council member Peterson, please. Oh, not yet. Great. Thank you. So I move to suspend the rules to allow us to vote on council bill 120214 on the same day as the public hearing. Is there a second? Second. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded to suspend the rules to allow a vote on the same day as the public hearing. Will the clerk please call the roll on suspending the rules to allow a vote on the same day as public hearing? Peterson? Yes. Council member Lewis? Yes. Council member Wise? Aye. Council member Mosqueda? Aye. Chair Strauss? Yes. Five in favor, none opposed. Thank you. The motion to allow a vote on the same day as a public hearing for council bill 120214 carry the motion carries. Our next action on this bill will be to vote it vote on it. And so at this time, colleagues, if you would like to speak, please do so I know Councilmember Mosqueda you&#39;ve been a co sponsor or prime sponsor over the course of many years on this. So I&#39;ll give you the last word. I do want to see Councilmember Peterson I saw your hand pop up. Would you like to say anything? Please. Thank you, Chair Strauss. And if it&#39;s okay with Councilmember Mosqueda, you prefer I go first. Okay. So just to address what some of the public commenters were saying and emails we&#39;ve received of people who do have concerns about this change, I feel that the more substantive discussion will be happening next year, that this is just a name change. While the ultimate goals of a name change might be different for different people at this time, I think just technically the actual substance will happen next year. And so I just want to assure people who are concerned about massive blanket changes to zoning that I will be asking questions about displacement, about preserving trees, about are we doing this for low-income housing, or are we doing it for real estate developer profit, you know, to make sure we achieve our goals and the details matter. But I&#39;ll be voting yes for this bill today because as my colleagues have said, it is technically just a name change at this point. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Peterson. Councilmember Lewis or Juarez, any further comments? Seeing none at this time, Councilmember Mosqueda, you will have the last word. Thank you very much. And just to follow up on what Councilmember Peterson said, I think I, as well as I think the whole Council, are interested in having those more robust conversations with every member of the community. That&#39;s what 2022 is dedicated to, stakeholder engagement as we lead up to the comprehensive plan. And I, too, will be making sure to prioritize how we couple policy changes that are driven by community with protecting and investing in more trees and protecting against displacement and promoting new policies to promote displacement as we also think about how to address comprehensive plan updates. So I look forward to those discussions in 2022 with all of you. I want to thank Councilmember Strauss for sponsoring this legislation that we have in front of us and the legislation that we co-sponsored this summer, amending the comprehensive plan to rename single family zones, the misnomer, into a more inclusive and accurate neighborhood residential term. I think this follow-up legislation allows for us to set the ground for good, reflective conversations in the upcoming year that reflect the true character of Seattle&#39;s neighborhoods as we embark to understand more about what changes community might desire as it relates to the comprehensive plan major updates, which we will work on addressing next year to create policies for really getting at the root of exclusionary zoning that is still making a mark and has a legacy in our land use and zoning policies in this city. I&#39;m excited about the legislation in front of us. As I am excited, I also want to recognize and lift up what Councilmember Peterson has noted, what Councilmember Strauss has noted, and what central staff has noted is that this will not update the zoning itself. We are working towards a more inclusive zoning strategy with policies that will be rooted in community desires as we work through the comprehensive plan major updates throughout 2022 to consider any policy changes in the year 2023. So the legislation in front of us really contains a technical change recognizing the term single family used in Seattle&#39;s planning language is a misnomer, as I&#39;ve said, has a legacy in exclusionary zoning practices, and that we as a city are committed to a more inclusive and accurate name as we think about where policy changes may lead in 2022 and 2023. We have proposed and adopted in the comprehensive plan the more inclusive, accurate name, neighborhood residential, recognizing that neighborhoods are already home to diverse housing. That was built before the increasingly restrictive zoning policies went into place. It includes housing, small businesses, parks, trees, schools, and services, as well as diverse housing types that include single family, but not only single family within those designations. So this legislation in front of us helps to reflect the reality that single family as a name doesn&#39;t reflect the current makeup of those neighborhoods. And again, I just have to mention the four-story brownstone that I used to live in on Queen Anne that had been basically effectively zoned into a single family area, but all around me were single family homes, as well as duplexes and triplexes and small apartment buildings like mine. And we want to actually have a name that&#39;s truly reflective. And so it is more accurately reflecting the neighborhood like I lived in and so many across the city. Further, from a purely technical perspective, single family has been a misnomer since 1994. Since 1994, when the ADU legislation, the Accessory Dwelling Unit legislation went into effect, which allowed more than one household to live on a single parcel, we have been operating with a misnomer on the books since 94. So this is a great opportunity to make that technical change. And again, I want to thank all of the council. And Councilmember Peterson, I really appreciate your comments as well, the full council for your support earlier this year, and Councilmember Strauss for your leadership on this issue, along with my staff, Erin House, who&#39;s been really the driving force in our office on community engagement and thinking through some of the technical change with ULISH. So thank you, ULISH, for all of your work with us on this. And Representatives Macri, Representative Fitzgibbon, Representative Chopp have all been incredibly helpful in thinking through how we create more inclusive language for our zoning conversations. So I want to thank them, along with the Seattle Housing Development Consortium, Seattle Southside, Chamber of Commerce, Sierra Club of Seattle, the AIA chapter, and Share Our Cities, along with 350 Seattle. Because when we create more opportunities for an inclusive Seattle, further people get pushed out of the city, further people are commuting in, and further fewer trees and fewer farmlands and wetlands are encroached upon when we allow for density to occur in our city. So looking forward to those conversations throughout next year, throughout 2022, and then to develop policy with you all in 2023. Thank you very much. Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda, well said. And while it is not related to we are not changing zoning with this bill, I will note that the entire state of California has done away with single-family zones. They are the sixth largest GDP in the world. So just as by context, I know it&#39;s going on throughout the country, and it&#39;s important that we&#39;re able to retain our neighborhood character and retain the way that our neighborhoods look, feel, and shape while we are able to bring more people into our communities. With that, I would like to move to recommend passage of 120214. Is there a second? Second. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded to recommend passage of Council Bill 120214.
