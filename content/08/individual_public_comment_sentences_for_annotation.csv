cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,But for now you can make general comments in this public comment period.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Go ahead, you have one minute.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Dear city council members, I'm a resident of district six, and I'm calling to ensure that Dan Strauss supports CB 120142 and the proposed amendment from the want to ensure that the policy is strongest and most coherent to serve the general public that it has promised to serve.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"As you all sit here today you have the opportunity to make history and guide local and even state governments across the nation and adopting such a policy that is not just historic, but long overdue.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,It is common sense that the police department should not be training with military police's and other surveillance and security forces of countries with grave violations of human rights.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Now you have this opportunity and the responsibility to demilitarize the police and I'm asking you to be on the right side of the history and pass Council Bill 120142 with council members to want amendment.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Thank you for your time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Thank you for calling in.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"I'm going to also call into the room now Shamir Tana looks like there might have been an accidental sign up for the public hearing on that, but the desire is to give public comment on other matters.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,So let's go ahead and pull up caller number 56. Shamir Tana.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Okay, Shamir go ahead and press star six, we'll go ahead and unmute you.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Go ahead.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Oh, thank you for taking my call.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"My name is Shamir Tana, I'm a resident of District 7.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,I'm calling in strong support of CB 120142 to stop SPD training if militaries are in violation of human rights according to international bodies like the UN.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"These are not opinions, this is international law.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Passing this bill is a necessary way for our city to demonstrate respect for human rights and dignity for all people.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,It's common sense and there's absolutely no reason that SPD or any police matter for that matter should be training with militaries or police or security forces with internally documented grave violations of human rights.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"I also strongly urge to adopt Councilmember Sawant's amendment, which makes the policy strong and most coherent.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Thank you for the time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Okay, I'm going to do one quick scan here.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Colleagues and members of the public, I do appreciate your patience.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,I know that it was a little confusing.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,There were a couple different options for folks to sign up for public comment this morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,I think folks got a little confused between the land use bill and the legislation that is sponsored by Councilmember Sawant.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,So I just want to do one quick review here to make sure that those who wanted to give general public comment on this and not the land use bill are actually going to have an opportunity to do that before we go ahead and close out public comment.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,I'm doing a quick scan here just to double check.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Okay, I have someone who called in who's actually wanted to call in in favor of the resolution related to the designation of Lenny Wilkins as caller number 41.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,That's George Northcroft.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"George, why don't we go ahead and bring you into the room and give you your one minute.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Go ahead, George, we can hear you.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,George I thought we could hear you a second ago now we can't make sure your actual device is also unmuted.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Can you hear me now.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"We can go ahead, George.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Okay.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Yes, I've been blessed to have Lenny Wilkins as a very close friend and extended family member for over 40 years.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"He's a gracious and inspiring man who has been recognized throughout the world as one of the greatest athletes, coaches, humanitarians, world ambassador, and advocate for children throughout his life.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"I've had the opportunity to meet Nelson Mandela, Bishop Fulton Sheen, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Prince Rene of Monaco and Prince Grace Kelly, Dr. Martin Luther King, Ted Turner, Andrew Young, Maynard Jackson, Jackie Robinson, President Barack Obama, and First Lady Michelle Obama, President Joe Biden, and First Lady Jill Biden, and Muhammad Ali and many others throughout his life.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"He's been guided by his mother Henrietta's words, your honesty and integrity to find your character.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Those that know Lenny well know he is a spiritual man and that his life aspirations surround his dedication to his wife and three children and seven grandchildren.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"He's a model, humble, very competitive.",

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Thank you very much for designating Lenny Wilkins' way for Lenny Wilkins.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"God bless him and you, the council.",

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"I'm here today to implore you to vote no on the Anti-Semitic Legislation Council Bill 120142, which would prohibit SPD training with certain foreign governments.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Not only does this legislation discredit racism in our policing system, but it will prohibit our police from working with countries on very important issues, such as the cooperation between Seattle Police Department and the Chinese government in combating sex trafficking.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"As a woman, and for that reason alone, I'm struggling to believe that this legislation is even being considered.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"So instead of considering this legislation, our elected representatives should be focusing on real policing reforms that our city desperately needs.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,So please vote no on this legislation.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,It will not fix the deep-rooted problems in our system of policing.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Thank you so much for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Okay, folks, I'm going to do one last scan here.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"I think we have made it to our hour, and also through everyone who signed up to speak on matters of general public comment.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,I'm just checking in with our IT folks just to make sure there isn't anyone else in the waiting room who signed up for general public comment in the interim.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,There's nobody else.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Okay, great.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,Thank you so much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b3c9f239a5c3,"Okay, folks, let's go ahead and end our period of public comment.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,The public comment period is now.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,Open.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,Each speaker will be given two minutes to speak.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f, And let me load up my list here.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,The folks who have signed up.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,"The first Speaker, speakers signed up is David Haynes, although it.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,Looks like he is not present currently.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,So we will go to Stephanie Anderson and Stephanie Anderson.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,You are recognized for two minutes.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f," Hi, thank you for your time.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,My name is Stephanie Anderson.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,I've been living in the sixth district here in valid for 24 years.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,I love this city.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,"I love Ballard and I've been, I've been a little distraught about the homeless encampment that have seemed to have gotten worse during the pandemic and I thought you guys a couple months ago and I just said, that's the plan.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,Let us know what's going on.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,I feel like there's a lack of information and I tried emailing and Contracting.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f, My representatives and just generally the leaders in this city and I can't tell what's going on.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,I see a lot of criticism in the newspaper and online about why this is getting worse.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,"And and what I would love if you guys have a plan and I know that you do, if you would just be more public about it, be the stronger about disseminating it.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,So we the people who don't necessarily want to go into politics.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f, But care deeply about our city and all the stuff that's going through.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,If you could just kind of keep us apprised.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,"I don't, I don't feel like I have any sense that there is a comprehensive plan or even a comprehensive agency, that's in charge of that, the public just a public person, could say, what's going on.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,What what's happening?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,Are they buying hotels?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,Are they getting social worker that attached to these people?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,And I guess I'm just here to today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f," You to say, if you have a plan and to have a comprehensive plan or even just the idea of a plan, share it with us, put it in the paper.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,Put it on social media.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,If it's if it's out there and I haven't seen it.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,Let me know.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,But I just feel like it would be so much more comforting to know that things are moving and that there's a plan in place.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f," And if anybody has a response as part of my two minutes, I'd love to hear it.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f, Next present speaker is Katherine.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,I'm sorry.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,I can't see the last name on the sheet here.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,"But Katherine, if Catherine is present is recognized for two minutes.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f, Gender.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f," Although, King County council members.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,"Thank you for considering permanent protection for renters, including cap on move in fees and deposits.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,"And allowing incremental payment requirement for landlords to give four months, notice for rent increases prohibitions, on rent, hikes and unlivable housing, adjusting, Ren on fixed incomes and prohibition on.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,Landlords requesting Social Security numbers for pre-written screaming.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,I,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f," We support these protections and urge you to pass this passage quickly, without weakening.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,It.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,"Do not let landlord lobbyists way you and watering down this bill low-income communities, and communities of color, have suffered the most during the pandemic.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,And now there are at the greatest risk of addiction renters need and deserve stronger protections.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,Both during recovery from the pandemic and permanently.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,"We already have an immense need for way, more permanent and deeply affordable housing.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,We will see this leaving Kris without these protection.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f," It is outrageous that in a city with so much wealth that we don't have a fordable housing for all, especially in times of emergency, such as snow, heat, waves, and smoke.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,Let's not exacerbate houses Miss by watering down this Bill.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f, I yield my time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f," And the next speaker is David Haynes, if David is here.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f,It looks like David is still not present.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,1ca25fd1350f," So if that's the case, I think that we will close the public comment period and proceed forward with the agenda.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Public comment period is now open.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The first few speakers on the list will be called.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,And remember to hit star 6 when you hear the prompt that you have been unmuted.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,That is your cue to hit star 6 so that you will be unmuted on your line.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,And that way we can hear you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"The first three people on my list today are Howard Gale, Peter Condon, and Jacob Shurer.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Good morning, Howard.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Howard Gale, District 7, speaking on the budget and police accountability.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"On September 18th, the Seattle Times covered the story of Howard McKay, a retired launch foreman and an elderly homeowner who was brutally assaulted in his own home by the Seattle police two years ago.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"When the Office of Police Accountability Director Andrew Meyerberg investigated McKay's assault, he deemed it, quote, lawful and proper, unquote, without even bothering to interview the officers involved.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The city recently settled with McKay for a quarter of a million dollars of our tax money to provide a small measure of justice otherwise unobtainable.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Our current police accountability system costs over $10 million.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"This means that taxpayers pay twice for police abuse, once to cover it up if that fails, a second time to compensate the victims.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The solidarity budget demands that police accountability be removed from the SPD.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"The mayor's budget gives more money to the SPD, including the bizarre addition of monies to fund a video propagandist at the OPA to convince Seattleites that videos of people being abused by police are not what they seem.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"At a minimum, all $10 plus million tied to the current police accountability system must be removed from the SPD and existing failed structures and redirected to create full civilian community control over police policy, misconduct investigations, and discipline.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Go to Seattlestop.org to find out how.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,That's Seattlestop.org.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The next person is Peter.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Good morning, Peter.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,This is Peter in district 6.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,City council should follow the recommendations of the solidarity budget and defund the police and municipal court by 50% in 2022.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"This can be done by reducing SPD's position authority to 750 sworn police officers, transferring civilian programs out of the department, and ending all cost spending on technology, weapons, buildings, and PR.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The idea that 125 new police officers can address Seattle's needs requires maintaining a false perception of the job.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Policing is defined by surveillance, violent detainment, and displacement of people.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"No police officer can house someone, no police officer can provide healthcare for someone, no officer can care for someone's child, and no police officer can protect someone from police violence itself.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Police actions can and do kill people.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Is that what you want to fund?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The most important feature of the solidarity budget is that it defunds the violent white supremacist structure that is the SPD.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"These cuts would supply critical permanent funding for housing and community-led public safety programs such as HSD community capacity building and participatory budgeting, both of which are already ramping up and will be putting money into community hands in 2022 or sooner.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"In contrast, the mayor's housing investments largely utilize one-time federal relief funds and are not the long-term solution Seattle needs.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Cops don't keep us safe.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Black lives matter.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Support the solidarity.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you very much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Jacob, good morning.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I'm an organizer with real change.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"And I'm calling on behalf of real change and our vendors to ask council to dramatically readjust the mayor's proposed budget to align with the actual needs of our community, which is laid out in the 2022 solidarity budget.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"The solidarity budget provides a deeply researched community-centered blueprint for providing true community care and safety, which was achieved by a participatory process that included people like real change vendors.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Our vendors have been directly impacted by policy choices and budgets like the one that Mayor Jerkin is proposing, and the solidarity budget reflects both the needs and ideas expressed by our vendors as to how we can create a city where all can thrive.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Our vendors need the commitment to funding deeply affordable and social housing laid out in the solidarity budget, not austerity and the hiring of more police to perpetuate racist violence and the criminalization of poverty.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Our vendors may not be fully aware of the difficulties we face with access to affordable housing.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Thus, the homelessness recommendations identified by the solidarity budget are urgently needed, stopping the sweeps, developing supplementary progressive revenue sources, and crucially earmarking 75% of jumpstart revenue to fund affordable housing at 0 to 30% of the area median income, to directly support our lowest wage workers and our neighbors currently living in the house.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you for your time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I look forward to hearing your insights and expertise of people like real change vendors into the council's 2022 budget.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you very much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"The next three speakers are Kaylee Condit, Madison Swain Bowden, and BJ Lass.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Good morning, Kaylee.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Hi.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"My name is Kaylee Condit, and I am an abolitionist in District 6 and a professor at the University of Washington.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,My work is to ensure that the city of Seattle has enough resources to meet the needs of its residents and their families.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"I have been working with the city of Seattle to follow the recommendations of the solidarity budget, and defund the police and municipal court by 50% in 2022.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"This can be done by reducing SPD's position authority over 750 sworn officers, transferring civilian programs out of the department, and ending all cop spending on technology, weapons, buildings, and PR.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,To address Seattle's needs requires maintaining a false perception of the job.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Policing is defined by surveillance, violent detainment, and displacement of people.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"No police officer can house someone, no officer can provide health care for someone, no officer can care for someone's child, and no police officer can protect someone from police violence itself.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Police actions can and do kill people.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Is that what you want to fund?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The most important features of the solidarity budget is that it defunds the violent white supremacist structure that is the SPD.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Cops don't keep us safe.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Black lives matter.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Black lives matter.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Support the solidarity budget and defund SPD.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I yield my time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"And good morning, Madison.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Can you hear me?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I can.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you so much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Perfect.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,My name is Madison and I'm a resident of District 5 and a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I'm calling in support of the solidarity budget which defunds SPD in the municipal court by 50%.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The solidarity budget should be the starting point for budget negotiations this year.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I urge the council to adjust the mayor's budget to align with the urgent needs that the community organizations have identified.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I'm especially concerned that Mayor Durkan's budget continues to give SPD more money than all of the human services department.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Which includes addressing homelessness, preparing youth for success, supporting affordability and livability, promoting public health, supporting safe communities, and promoting healthy aging combined.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I urge the council to adjust the solidarity budget to align with the urgent needs that the community organizations have identified.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Particularly when seven out of nine members of this council committed to defunding SPD by 50%.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"This year alone, SPD has murdered three members of our community.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"They also, by way of their spog mouthpiece, Mike Solan, have said that they will refuse to comply with the vaccine mandate.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,These people are lawless.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Great work, SPD.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,You're doing a wonderful job.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,There's more money for you to use to brutalize the community.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"We need these millions of dollars that are currently in SPD's budget to be freed up to invest in housing, the green new deal, transportation, education, child care, food sovereignty, indigenous sovereignty and so much more.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thanks for calling in this morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"BJ, good morning.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,You are up next.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"I'm calling in support of the solidarity budget, which defunds SPD in the municipal court by 50%.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The solidarity budget should be the starting point for budget negotiations this year.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I urge council to adjust the mayor's budget to align with the urgent needs that community organizations laid out in their proposal.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"I'm especially concerned that mayor Durkin's budget keeps civilian positions, including the community service officers, CSOs, in SPD.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"If these positions are to be true service providers, they should be transferred to the CSCC, where they'll be under civilian control, where the funding for them should be reallocated to community organizations.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Leaving these positions in SPD embeds them in the culture of SPD.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"That's a culture where the center for policing equity found that even after almost a decade of the consent decree, officers stop black and indigenous people more than five times as frequently as white people and use force against black people at more than seven times the rate as white people, despite the fact that white people are most likely to be found with a weapon when they are searched.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"And additionally, 65% of JumpStart revenue should be allocated for acquisition and operating costs of deeply green, affordable housing.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"We need the millions of dollars that SPD is currently in SPD's budget freed up to invest in housing, the Green New Deal, transportation, education, child care, food sovereignty, indigenous sovereignty, and so much more.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,This is not a choice of funding priorities.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,SPD harms the community with its biased practice.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you very much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"The next three speakers are Hattie Rhodes, Trevona Thompson-Wiley, and Josh Castle.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Good morning, Hattie.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Hey, Hattie, if you are speaking, you are still muted.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Can you hit star six one more time, please?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,There you are.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Hi.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Hello.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Thank you, city council members.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,My name is Hattie Rhodes.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I'm the village operations manager for Lehigh's Georgetown Tiny House Village.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I wanted to express my gratitude for you all for your ardent support of the Tiny House Village program.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Currently, I live in District 3, but I used to live in District 2 in the Tiny House Village.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Before I arrived there, I had been living in a tent in downtown Seattle.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I was without hope for a future.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I had a full-time job and had paid for numerous application fees for apartments that had never become signing a lease.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I was cold and wet when I went to work in the winters.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The Tiny House Village offered me more than a traditional shelter could.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"It offered me a safe place to stay warm, keep my things dry, a space where I could breathe again.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,It gave me my dignity back.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Your support of the Tiny House Villages helped save lives.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Yes, I now work for the Tiny House Villages, but how could I not?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"I want to help others achieve the same thing that I got, permanent housing.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Should they be forced to suffer on the streets until that housing is available?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Should people living in their cars have to go through figuring out how to get housing on their own?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Or should they be offered a place that has dignity in a tiny house where we have case managers that will help people get their IDs, help them navigate the housing market, where other community members such as Healthcare for the Homeless or Recovery Cafe know they can find their clients?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,You should all be proud of the Tiny House Villages that you have supported.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Thank you, and sorry to cut you off.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Please send the remainder of your comments in.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Good morning, Trevona.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Hi, my name is Trevona, and I'm a resident of District 2.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Many of today's listeners have heard me give public comment and demand changes to the City of Seattle.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Your community has been calling for a deep investment in addressing community basic needs and community-led programs around harm reduction and transformative justice.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"I'm calling in support of the Solidarity Budget, which defunds SPD and the mythical court by 50%.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The Solidarity Budget should be the starting point for budget negotiations this year.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I urge Council to adjust the Mayor's budget to align with the urgent needs that the community organizations have identified and laid out in this very detailed proposal.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I'm extremely worried about Mayor Durkan using $1.1 million for hiring bonuses for SPD despite SPD officers being some of the highest-paid city employees.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Why are we not investing that in housing?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Why are we continuing to let people suffer?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,We literally have SPD sweeping Cascade Playground as we speak right now.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"And in a city that literally lies about being compassionate and being progressive, the City Council needs to stand by all community members.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"We need millions of dollars that are currently in SPD's budget to be freed up to invest in housing, the Green New Deal, transportation, education, child care, food sovereignty, indigenous sovereignty, and so much more.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,This is pretty basic knowledge that you should simply care about people and that we need to stop investing in institutions that brutalize folks and that we truly need to invest in helping people.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,And I really appreciate it.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you very much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The next person is Josh Castle.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Good morning, Josh.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"I'm Josh Castle, Community Engagement Director with Lehigh.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I want to thank the City Council for your support of the recently announced $50 million to rapidly create new affordable permanent housing in Seattle and specifically the $28.5 million of ARPA funding you passed in June.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"This will open up 165 new homes in three buildings that will be owned by Lehigh, two of which operated by Lehigh, for tenants exiting homelessness in tiny house villages before winter strikes.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,We are grateful to our partnership with Youth Care who will operate one of the buildings and will serve young adults and many LGBTQ youth exiting homelessness.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"These homes will provide permanent supportive housing for 180 women and men, including singles, couples, and people with pets who are transitioning out of our tiny house villages and emergency shelters.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"As with our villages, these buildings will each have talented on-site case managers to provide supportive services and 24-7 operational staff.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Between this and several other developments such as George Plumbing Place, now accepting applications, this will bring Lehigh to over 70 permanent housing buildings and over 2,500 units of permanent housing for residents who came from homelessness, many who spent some months in a tiny house village, receiving case management support to obtain housing, and are now entering into permanent homes.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Lehigh also opened the Clay Apartments in March that is now providing homes for 30 residents who transitioned from our villages.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"We are grateful to all of you on the Council, and these investments are saving lives by getting people...",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you very much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"The next three speakers are Katie Rubin, Pini O'Grady, and Sarah C.",

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Good morning, Katie.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,My name is Kate Rubin.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I'm a renter living in District 2 and the Executive Director of the Housing Justice Organization v. Seattle.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Seattle is one of the most deeply impacted cities in the nationwide housing crisis.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"As endorsers of the Solidarity Budget, we are calling on the city to defund SPD and the Municipal Court by 50%, stop the sweeps, and invest deeply in housing, including creating permanent, deeply affordable housing, housing acquisition, land banking, emergency shelter, and tenant services, including legal aid, eviction prevention, tenant education and organizing, and connecting renters to existing city services.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Homelessness has been in a declared state of emergency since 2015, and the working class, who have proven to be essential in keeping our city operating during a global pandemic, are continuously being pushed further and further outside of Seattle's city limits, with Black and Brown communities being disproportionately displaced.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,We all deserve housing stability.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,We need to listen to the people who are most impacted.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Many of the folks experiencing homelessness are labeled as service-resistant when the services currently available actually decrease the level of stability that they have in their tents and RVs, where at least they can be with their partners and pets.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"No one wants to live in a park, and shuffling those who have ended up there somewhere else is a waste of taxpayer dollars and causing further harm and displacement.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"We need RV safe lots with wraparound services, increased sanitation services, and permanent housing options, not just shelter beds.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Please protect all Seattle residents, invest in our communities, and use the Solidarity Budget as a starting point of budget negotiations this year.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Thank you very much, Kate.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,And Peony O'Grady.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,My name is Penny.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Sorry about that.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I'm calling in support.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,That's okay.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I'm calling in support of the Solidarity Budget.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,It invests appropriately in our unhoused neighbors and other urgent community needs by defunding SPD and the municipal court by 50%.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Do you remember what happened last summer after the city of Seattle George Floyd's brutal murder?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Do you remember the groundswell of activism insisting that the system of racism and poverty be turned on its head?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"And do you remember the ugly police response to people protesting racist police brutality, the very demonstration of violent policing here in Seattle?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"People were touched then by a vision to build a better, more just Seattle.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,And do you remember city council committing to defund the police by 50% to that end?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The Solidarity Budget balances necessary spending on true community safety by reducing the size and scope of the overfunded police department.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I call on you to adjust the mayor's proposed budget to align with the urgent needs of our unhoused neighbors and other urgent community needs.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,And I call on you to adjust the mayor's proposed budget to align with the urgent needs that more than 90 underfunded community organizations have endorsed.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,It is a road map for the kind of safe city we all need and no more sweeps.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I've saved my time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Thanks for calling in today, Penny.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,And Sarah still says that you are listed as not present.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,We do have three more speakers that are listed as present.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I'm going to read your names and then I'm going to read the names of the folks who are not present.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"So everybody knows if you're listening, now's the time to call in.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"The next three speakers that are present will be Allah Hassan, Andra Krentzler, and Bob Finlay.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The people that are listed as not present.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Again, Sarah C., Teresa Barker, Bill Smith, Coco Weber, and Samrita Kandar.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"So good morning, Allah.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"And if anybody heard their name and you do want to still testify, please call in.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Good morning, Allah.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,My name is Allah Hassan and I manage the volunteers with Low Income Housing Institute.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Before my current role, I was a case manager at Fry Apartments, a permanent supportive housing site.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"While supporting over 230 residents at the Fry, I had the opportunity to listen to their stories and many who had transitioned from tiny house villages.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,They were able to rebuild their lives thanks to the onsite supportive staff at each tiny house village.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Our case managers help them get access to permanent housing.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"That's what tiny house villages offer, the support necessary to connect individuals to resources, help them find a source of income, apply for IDs, or provide support through the immigration process.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Each resident receives an insulated and heated home with a door that locks.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"They are welcoming for couples and pets, unlike congregate shelters, which do not provide the same level of safety and security for homeless individuals with unique circumstances.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"In fact, our tiny house village program has a 99% utilization rate compared to basic congregate shelters because chronically homeless individuals find greater security and privacy with tiny house villages.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Now as I manage our volunteers, I get to see the other side of the spectrum.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"We have hundreds of volunteers building tiny houses, neighbors that want to take direct action and address the homelessness crisis and give back to their communities.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Thanks to the city council support, we are able to activate people into these positions, and we are able to put up walls and a roof to insulate each house and to provide a welcoming environment to homeless individuals.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you very much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"And Andra, you are up next.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Good morning, city council members.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you for the work you are doing to address homelessness and housing instability.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"In my humble opinion, deep investment in housing stability for renters is the number one way we keep our public safe.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,My name is Andra Kranzler.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I'm here on behalf of the Tenant Law Center.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I am the new directing attorney.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Our partnership with the city provides vital legal advocacy for renters experiencing housing instability.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I would like to thank you for funding eviction prevention work and the social services necessary to help people most vulnerable to ending up homeless.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,The funding allocated for housing attorneys to work in concert with the city of Seattle's Department of Construction and Inspection is a vital resource for renters in need of housing justice.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,It is truly helping those most vulnerable to eviction and homelessness stay housed in both market rate unit and subsidized public housing.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"TLC is able to collaborate with community partners like Solid Ground to connect with tenants early on and help them equitably resolve a myriad of housing disputes, whether that's at the beginning of tenancy to remove barriers so that they can get into an eligible unit that maybe they were referred to through the rapid rehousing program and maybe using eviction prevention funds or the emergency assistance dollars provided throughout the council's history but also through this COVID time period.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,We are able to negotiate on tenants' behalf to resolve warranty of habitability issues.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"But most importantly, we couldn't do this without your investments in case management, new housing, maintenance of existing housing stock.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,We need.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Please send in the rest of your comments, Sandra.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,And the last two speakers are Bob and Samira Kandar.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Good morning, Bob.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Hi, Seattle City Council.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you for this opportunity.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I am a resident of District 2 represent.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"And I'd like, like many people here, I am here to speak on behalf of the solidarity budget.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"And I would encourage the council to adopt the solidarity budget because for many of the reasons that have already eloquently be expressed, including it would allow you to keep your commitment of defunding Seattle Police Department by at least 50%.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"I also, I just want to observe that Jenny Durkin isn't even running for reelection.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"So I would just question why anyone would, why her budget is even being considered.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Also, it's not too late for her to resign in disgrace.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,And I also want to give a shout out to tiny house villages.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you very much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Bye-bye.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you very much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,And Samira.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"Hi, my name is Samira Kandar.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,And I am living in district seven.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,I'm calling in support of the solidarity budget.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"For the housing and homeless recommendation, specifically also defunding SPD and the municipal court by at least 50% and stopping the sweeps, which are uncool and inhumane.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,They're in opposition to the CDC guidelines for public health safety during the pandemic.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"We are all living through, including our houseless neighbors.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,They are also ineffective.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Most people who are swept just end up moving somewhere else.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,So I'm calling in support of the solidarity budget.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"We are all living through, including our houseless neighbors.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,They are also ineffective.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Most people who are swept just end up moving somewhere else because we don't have enough permanent housing.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Options for members of our community.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"They are like evictions and we should have a moratorium on these sweeps, just like we have a moratorium on our evictions.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"We shouldn't be sending the parks and recreation department, additional funding to sweep people from their homes.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,"We are also looking for the allocating of 65% of the jumpstart revenue, which is at least 132 million annually to be dedicated to the construction or acquisition and operating and service costs for deeply affordable green housing.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,That is the most sustainable and effective way we can all work to address the housing issue that members of our community have been facing for years at this point.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,It's the only effective humane option because clearly what Seattle has been doing is not being done.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,We are not going to be able to do that.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Thank you very much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,d9f30ac22162,Folks that does conclude all of our public comment.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"The public comment period is now open at 934 a.m., and we will begin with the first speaker on the list.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"We have three speakers signed up to speak this morning, Steve Zemke, Kaitlin Bram, and Jessica Dixon.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Steve, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"I see you there, if you unmute.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,Star six on your end.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,There we are.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Good morning, Steve.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,My name is Steve Zemke.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"I'm a former member of the Seattle Urban Forest Commission, having served over six years.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,My comments relate to the Urban Forestry Commission presentation.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"It's my opinion, after being involved over 12 years and trying to work for an updated tree and urban forest protection ordinance, that the Urban Forest Commission has become in large part just another member of the public.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,It's mostly on the outside looking in.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Two examples of this, one is the development of the urban forest management plan, the draft plan produced.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Mostly the commissioners had several talking sessions, but were not involved in writing or reviewing the draft prior to its release for public comment.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"The commission reviewed the publicly released draft and submitted comments like other members of the public, and we do not know if these concerns that were addressed by the commission will be incorporated in the final draft presented to you, the council, to adopt.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,The other is the confusion over what is happening with updating the urban forest tree protection ordinance that it says in the work plan that the OSC be involved in deliberative sessions on the tree and urban forest protection ordinance with SBCI and OSE.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"There were no deliberative sessions held in 2020 specifically relating to the draft tree ordinance, or issues as mentioned in 31902.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"The commission was involved in reviewing regulations, but not in discussing potential ordinance language.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"And a note in the urban forest management plan, actually, it says that SBCI alone will be involved in, quote, an update of city tree protection regulations.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Nowhere is there mention of an update of the ordinance, nor does it mention that the OSE or the urban forestry commission should be involved.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,So we think you need to be aware.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,We think that this is just more continuation of prolonging this process without action.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Thank you, Steve.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Up next, we have Caitlin Bram, followed by Jessica Dixon.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Good morning, Caitlin.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Good morning, everyone.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"This is Caitlin Bram, the founder of Yonder Cider.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,Thank you for having me.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,I am calling in support of the bringing business home small business flexibility bill.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"As many of you probably know by this point, Yonder Cider had a small garage operation that was a retail only, quote, unquote, tasting room out of my personal garage in my home in the Finney Ridge Greenwood neighborhood.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,We ended up closing our doors to our retail establishment on February 15th due to zoning issues.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,We had been open for six months.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,I'm calling in support of the bill because I want to emphasize what opening in our garage did for Yonder Cider.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"We had plans for a full tasting room when we began this process, but, of course, that was in January of last year when the pandemic hit in March, so all of our plans changed.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,Being able to launch a business and launch a brand with no tasting room and with no retail presence is challenging.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"It's also challenging as a very small business just getting started to look at commercial leases for five to seven years, unknowing the viability of your business and how successful it will be, and if in a year you'll still be around.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"By opening our business in our garage, we were able to kickstart Yonder and to grow its success from the ground up.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"We, of course, went through all of the licensing that we need to do with the Liquor Control Board, which is not for the faint of heart, mind you, before we opened and slowly but surely gained support of our neighborhood.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"We did announce about three or four weeks ago that we were closing our doors and have been working with zoning to try and find a solution, but at the end, the solution that was given did not make it able for us to continue staying open.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"We had to close our doors, but did receive 4,200 signatures in support.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"What Yonder Cider has done and what Yonder Bar, as we lovingly call it, has done is provide a vibrant place for people to walk to during the pandemic.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"It's also provided a friendly neighborhood feeling, and it's provided Yonder Cider with the ability to succeed, and I hope to see this.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Thank you, Caitlin, and if you would like to follow up with any more written comments, feel free to email us, dan.strouse at Seattle.gov.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Last signed up, we have Jessica Dixon.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"If other members of the public would like to sign up, please do so, and we will call on you.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Otherwise, we will end public comment after Jessica speaks.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Good morning, Jessica.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,I see you're unmuted.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Good morning, Council.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,Thank you for allowing me to speak.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Again, I'm Jessica Dixon.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,I'm on the Finney Ridge Community Council Board and a volunteer with Plant Amnesty.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,I'm calling in this morning to support the Urban Forestry Commission's efforts to work with city agencies and the council to update both the Exceptional Tree Director's Rule and the Seattle Tree Ordinance.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,Seattle's urban forest is an integral and vital part of our city.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,It provides many benefits and amenities to everyone living in our city now and in the future.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Trees help clean our air, enhance public health, reduce stormwater runoff, mitigate climate change, decrease the impacts of excessive heat and wind, provide habitat for birds and wildlife and connect us with nature in our urban neighborhoods.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,Seattle's current rules regarding tree removal have not been effective in identifying and preserving trees.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Due to increasing densification of our residential neighborhoods, where, according to the 2016 LiDAR study, 72% of our trees are located, Seattle is rapidly losing its urban canopy and the critical functions a robust tree canopy provides.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,It is imperative that the council pass not only an updated director's rule that clarifies the current tree protection ordinance but prioritizes passing the updated tree ordinance drafted by the Urban Forestry Commission.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,It balances tree preservation and growth with a goal of a net increase in the Seattle urban tree cover to reach the city's stated goal of 30% tree canopy.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"It is urgent that the mayor and the city council act now to stop the loss of trees, particularly exceptional trees, heritage trees and tree groves throughout the city and to promote environmental equity as we commit to increasing our tree canopy.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Thank you, Jessica.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,"Mr. Ahn, RIT, can you confirm we have no other speakers signed up to speak?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,Affirmative.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,7808ab837c23,There are no more registrants.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Colleagues, public comment period is now open.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"It is 2.22, so we will go until 2.52 p.m. approximately, and the first two names on my list are Howard Gale and Grayson Van Arsdale.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Howard, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Hi.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Good morning, or afternoon.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm Howard Gale, commenting on continuing police abuse and failed accountability.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I am often asked what explains the Council members' repeated strong emotional responses to the police murder of George Floyd, but the near total silence and total inaction on the recent SBD murders of Ayose Ofalotogo, Danny Rodriguez, Ryan Smith, Sean Ferg, Terry Kaver, and Derek Hayden.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I just launched a Twitter poll to try to answer this question, with the possible explanations being they were bad people, the SBD is always right.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I didn't notice who died.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And lastly, the SBD is reformed and we have adequate accountability, so there can't be a problem.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I would invite the Council members to comment on Twitter if they think there are other reasons for their complacence and silence.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Personally, I believe the last option to be the explanation that the discomfort and cognitive dissonance created by questioning our accountability system is so great that you just assume these SBD murders must be justified, thereby avoiding questioning them.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We need full civilian control of the police now.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Grayson VanArsdale, followed by Sujatha Romney.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Grayson, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Hi.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I'm Grayson.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm a renter in the Central District, and I want to urge City Council to pass Council Member Salwan's resolution stating that the Biden administration should waive patent restrictions for vaccines.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Vaccine equity should concern all of us.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Seattle isn't a closed, isolated system, and vaccine access in the Global South is an urgent issue for the entire world.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"India charted 350,000 cases in a single day this past week, forcing the Biden administration to plan to share 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is still woefully inadequate and does nothing structurally to help the Global South respond to outbreaks.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Poor countries shouldn't have to depend on the whims of the United States government for vaccine access, and they should be able to manufacture the doses they need.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"There isn't a credible reason to not pass this resolution, in my view, and there's also no credible way to minimize the impact that this resolution from the City Council could have.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Seattle has in the past set national and international precedents, and if the members of the City Council do believe in people over profit, you should pass this resolution immediately because that is the core of this question.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Sujatha Romney, followed by Daniel Kavanaugh.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Good afternoon.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,My name is Sujatha Romney.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I am a member of the Coalition of Seattle Indian Americans.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I urge the Council to pass Councilmember Saravanan's resolution urging President Biden to suspend IP claims to the COVID vaccine without any delay.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"While civil society is focused on a temporary suspension of the TRIPS provision, let me highlight the fact that pharma companies are racketeering with vaccines.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,The mRNA technique itself was a product of taxpayer-funded research.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Oxford University was strong-armed into selling its IP to AstraZeneca by our very own beloved vaccine racketeer, Bill Gates.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Grabbing public goods and selling it back to the public at inflated prices is nothing short of looting.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,The U.S. government must stop being an agent of these looters and racketeers and must permanently waive all IP claims to the vaccine and openly share technical know-how with the world.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Daniel Kavanaugh, followed by Marina Skumanich.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Hey, my name's Dan.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm a member of Socialist Alternative and a renter in the CD, and Councilmembers need to urgently pass Councilmember Saravanan's resolution on vaccine patents.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And the Council can have an impact on global issues.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Last year, our movement won a Council resolution against racist citizenship laws in India.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Five U.S. cities followed suit, and it played a role in international pressure, forcing Modi to walk back the attack.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And lifting these patents is urgent.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"The longer the virus exists anywhere, the more of a threat it is to ending the pandemic everywhere, with the possibility of vaccine-resistant strains.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And Trump blocked the vaccine patent waiver in December, but now we've had a new administration for three months.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We need to pass this without delay.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And to everyone listening in, I just want to say capitalism has completely failed to deal with the pandemic.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Vaccine companies are putting profits over world health.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,They pour money into both political parties.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And we need to fight for every victory we can win today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,But the huge problems we face can't be solved on the basis of capitalism.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We need to get organized to fight for a socialist world.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Marina, followed by Madeline Olson.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Okay.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Here I am.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Marina Sumanich.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thanks for listening to me speak.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I urge you to vote yes on the TRIPS waiver resolution for COVID vaccines.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"This is a matter of the utmost urgency, given the raging pandemic.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And rarely is it the case in policy that the most altruistic impulse is directly in sync with the most crass self-interested calculation.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,But that is the case here.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,For no one is safe from COVID unless all of us are made safe.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,So we must act to facilitate vaccine manufacture.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And this is not a time to let other secondary mercenary concerns distract us.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I know many will claim that it is not the Seattle City Council's business to pass resolutions related to international law.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I say it is always appropriate for elected officials to express the strong ethical principles of their constituents.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And in this case, from the city level on up, our community health programs are directly and strongly affected by the decisions made at the international level on this issue.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We cannot afford to ignore it.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I urge you to do the right thing for your constituents and vote yes.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Thank you, Marina.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Madeline, followed by Zoe Amer.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Hi there.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Can you hear me?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We can.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Go ahead.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Great.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I'm Madeline.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I'm a renter in Green Lake.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And I just want to urge city councils to support the resolution urging Biden to waive IP claims.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"You know, obviously we're facing an unprecedented global pandemic.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And these conditions call for a serious and a rapid response.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Delaying vaccine access for nations by not waiving IP only hurts our chances as an international community to see an end to the pandemic.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And by denying vaccines to other nations, we'll just see more waves and we'll see more strains emerge and potentially seeing the vaccines become less effective with these new strains emerging.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Some folks might be thinking this isn't a Seattle issue.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,But we can't afford to sit idly by when enforcement of patent restrictions puts us all at risk for continued exposure for years.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"In fact, there is a precedent for Seattle to take a stand.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"In February of last year, Seattle passed a resolution opposing Islamophobic laws passed by the Modi government.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And this resolution in this city set the tone for several other cities to take the same stance and it led to the government to back away from passing that law.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,It's clear what happens here in Seattle does have international implications.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,So it's vital we act now.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And I urge city council, you have the opportunity to not only do the easy thing but do the right thing and take a stand.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thanks.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Next up is Zoe followed by Margo Stewart.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Hello.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,My name is Zoe Amer in District 4.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I'm here to urge city council to pass council member Sawant's resolution.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,All year the city council has given lip service to acknowledging the origins of racism in this country and their commitment to combat racism within our institutions.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We know that the origin of racism in the U.S. especially is private property.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"The same logic that enabled slavery now prevents countries, disproportionately countries formerly colonized and exploited by the U.S. and Europe from producing COVID vaccines that can save millions of lives.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,The hoard the vaccine patents for the profit of mega pharma companies and investors is openly to put white supremacist profit above all else.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Bill Gates here in Washington state just publicly defended the hoarding of vaccine patents citing concerns about safety of production in countries like India which is simply veiled racism when India already produces over half the generic brand medicines consumed in the U.S.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,This makes it crucial for working people in Seattle to take a stand against vaccine racism and in solidarity with workers globally.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And the next speaker is hold on just a minute here.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Next up is Margo.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Go ahead, Margo.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And then after Margo is going to be Bia LeCombe.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Sorry I didn't mean to jump the gun there.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,But my name is Margo.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I'm a renter in the central district and I'm calling also in support of council member Sawant's resolution calling on the Biden administration to waive patent protections on the COVID-19 vaccine.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,A year ago we know the city was at the epicenter of the COVID outbreak in the United States and that's liable to be the case again in the future if there are unvaccinated people anywhere in the world.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,None of us are safe from new strains and that includes here in Seattle.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And I think that's also to say nothing of prolonging the cycle we've already seen of endless lockdowns and then premature reopenings that working people have had to bear the brunt of the consequences for.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,This is a global crisis and we need a coordinated global response to it.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I think the city council or the city council has the power to take a stand against preventable loss of life that's taking place right now simply to defend the profits of these big pharmaceutical companies who were in reality totally negligent in preparing for this crisis.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And as others have already noted these vaccines were developed with public funds.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,There's a clear precedent with the council's stand against the citizenship law in India last year.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And so I urge the council to follow that precedent again and pass this resolution.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Thank you, Margo.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Next up is Bia followed by Hillary Hayden.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Hi, my name is Bia.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I'm a renter.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Hi.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Can you hear me?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Yep, we can.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Sorry about interrupting you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Go ahead.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,That's OK.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,My name is Bia and I'm a renter in District 3.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,The Seattle City Council should absolutely be calling on President Biden to immediately waive patent and IP restrictions on COVID vaccines.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Big pharmaceutical companies are making enormous profits by hoarding vaccines for rich countries.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Why should they be allowed to profit when it was the billions of dollars of public resources that made the COVID vaccines possible?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I think the public working people everywhere should have free and immediate access to the vaccines that our tax dollars paid for with millions of lives at stake and the potential development of vaccine resistant strains.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We need amendments like this passed in every city starting here in Seattle.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Big Pharma billionaires have been lobbying hard against these waivers.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"The Democrats are extremely cozy with Big Pharma, so the only thing that's going to pressure them to act is a grassroots movement that takes up these demands and escalates the pressure on the Democrats to respond.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We need a local protest action on April 30th to build pressure on the World Trade Organization and expose the despicable role of billionaires like Bill Gates.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Next up is Hillary Hayden followed by Prashant Nima.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Awesome.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I'm Hillary Hayden.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm the executive director at the Washington Fair Trade Coalition, and I'm here to urge you to vote also in favor of Council Member Sawant's resolution today.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Former President Trump was at the center of the U.S.'s decision not to support a TRIPS waiver at the WTO.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"President Biden himself said that he supported this during his campaign, and his own U.S. trade rep, Catherine Tai, signaled U.S. openness to the waiver in her remarks at the WTO only two weeks ago.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"For the International Chamber of Commerce, without the waiver, there will be a $9.2 trillion hit to the global economy, and $4.5 trillion of that will be borne by the Global North.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"For Seattle, that means fewer jobs and a slow and prolonged economic recovery.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,It also means fewer contracts for companies operating internationally in the Puget Sound like Boeing.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Seattle City Council's voice in this is critical.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I urge you to pass this resolution and send the message to President Biden that Seattle City Council has his back when it comes to backing the TRIPS waiver.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Prashant, followed by Blythe Serrano.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And Prashant, if you're with us, make sure you press star six so that we can hear you.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Can you hear me now?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We can.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Go ahead.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Yeah.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"My name is Prashant, and I'm a member of the Coalition of Seattle Indian Americans.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I urge the council to pass Council Member Sawant's resolution urging the U.S. government to issue IP waivers on COVID-19 vaccines, share the R&D know-how on vaccines, ban all kinds of compulsory surge pricing, lift export bans on vaccine supplies, and release the inventory of AstraZeneca immediately.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I'm reporting on the situation in India.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"While the Brahmin supremacist Indian government is plenty to blame for its shoddy handling of the crisis, vaccine inequity is the biggest obstacle in the current situation.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Cases have gone up in India 10 times in the past month.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Daily deaths are at a level we witnessed in the U.S. in December.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Unfortunately, the worst is yet to come.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"This is not an issue of a far-off world, as some respectable people claim.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,The COVID virus is notorious for boarding business class and arriving in any part of the world in hours.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Leaving too many people unvaccinated in any part of the world is dangerous.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Vice President Kamala Harris, performative display of your Indian roots eating masala dosas are not enough.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Your chittis and chittapas are dying in the house in thousands.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,It takes moral will to stand up against the neoliberal corporate lobbies forever and to do the right thing to save women lives.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Do it now.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Blythe, followed by Harry Katz.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Hi, my name is Blythe Serrano.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm a renter in Mount Baker, and I'm calling to support council members to launch vaccine resolution.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Over 400 international organizations, such as Doctors Without Borders, and over 100 countries support waiving intellectual property restrictions for the COVID vaccine.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,But the U.S. and a handful of other World Trade Organization members are blocking this waiver.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"This blockade started under Trump, and Biden has the power to reverse it.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"But big pharmaceutical companies and billionaires like Bill Gates are, as always, doing everything in their power to protect their profits, even at the cost of human life.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,They've already sent over 100 lobbyists to pressure the Biden administration to continue to oppose the vaccine waiver.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Public health experts say that if the status quo is maintained, it will literally be years before people in the global South get the vaccine.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"During the AIDS epidemic 20 years ago, people in high-income countries got access to life saving medication, while millions in developing countries were left to die.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"It's critical that the Seattle City Council passes this resolution now, urging the Biden administration to do their part to prevent this tragic narrative from playing out again with COVID.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Harry Katz, followed by Khan Hassan.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Hi, council members.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,My name is Harry Katz from Seattle.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for the opportunity to speak in support of the resolution on the WTO patent waiver.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I was relieved to get vaccinated, but I also feel heartbroken that I can have more vaccines in my body than all the doctors, seniors, and sick people in 130 countries put together.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I highly recommend the article, if you haven't seen it yet, in today's Washington Post by Joe Stiglitz on why the WTO waiver would be both necessary and effective in increasing vaccine access.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Letting the pandemic keep raging in developing countries threatens millions of lives, and it's also harming developing countries' economies and their ability to invest in climate action.",

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Khan Hassan, followed by Martha Baskin.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Good afternoon.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"This is Khan Hassan, member of the Coalition of Seattle Indian Americans.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I urge the city council to pass council member Sawant's COVID IP waiver resolution that covers the following five points.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"The first one is put people over profit, suspend trips around COVID, endorse the CTAP process put forth by the WTO, reject the COVAX sham proposed by disaster capitalists like Bill Gates and the pharma companies, ship stockpiles of AstraZeneca that they are hoarding to countries like India where the pandemic is out of control, share information and resources freely and proactively to bring the pandemic under control and save lives.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Have a nice day.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next we will hear from Martha Baskin, followed by Ellen Anderson.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And Martha, if you are on the line with us, remember to press star six.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,DT confirmed that Martha is still with us.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Affirmative.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,The caller is on the line.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Great.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Martha, we still can't hear you, so you'll need to press star six one more time.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Make sure it's the star button, not the pound button.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Star six.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,There we go.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Finally.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,My apologies.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,My apologies.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Yes.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"So as you're hearing strongly, the cry for a vaccine for all, one that is free, just and accessible is being heard around the world.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"The head of the WHO has decried what he calls the grotesque global inequality of vaccine distribution, especially when the world has the means to avert the resulting catastrophe.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,But he fell short in demanding that IP rights be waived through the WTO.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,This is where Samah Sawant's resolution comes in very strongly.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,A leading NIH scientist who helped develop a key technology used in Pfizer and Moderna's coronavirus vaccine said last week that the U.S. government's ownership of the patent for the invention gives the Biden administration significant leverage to compel pharmaceutical companies to help boost global production.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Dr. Barney Graham, deputy director of the NIH's Vaccine Research Center, told the Financial Times, quote, virtually everything that comes out of the government's research lab is a non-exclusive licensing agreement so that it doesn't get blocked by any particular company.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"In fact, prior to the WTO and the proliferation of trade treaties, countries around the world regularly used compulsory licensing to make the pharmaceutical industry allow local manufacturers to produce drugs after paying a license fee.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,It's estimated that nine out of 10 people in countries without the means to purchase patented vaccines won't have access this year.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,An analysis from Agency France-Presse puts the inequality in stark terms.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Thank you, Martha.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Some 66 percent of the doses.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Thank you so much, Martha.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I wish we could hear everybody's testimony.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm sorry, but we only have one minute for each speaker before the microphone will be automatically muted, but I appreciate you calling in.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,You're welcome to send in the rest of your comments to the full council at council at Seattle.gov.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up, we are going to hear from Ellen Anderson, followed by Erica Myers.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Ellen, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Hi.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,My name is Ellen.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm from Beacon Hill, and I'm calling to encourage folks to support Sharma Sawant's legislation.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"So we've seen that Biden has lifted the ban on exporting materials for vaccines to India, and this is definitely one step towards fixing the preexisting vaccine nationalism that has really focused on profit over accessibility.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And intellectual property rights around the COVID vaccine are absolutely limiting access right now.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And the city's council currently has an opportunity to push back against the WTO's rules that require countries to guarantee pharmaceutical corporations' monopoly control.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Rapid production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine is essential.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,This virus does not care about borders.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And right now, India is getting hit with over 300,000 cases reported in a single day.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,They need these vaccines yesterday because these vaccines cannot be seen as anything other than a global public good.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And everyone on this planet needs to be able to be vaccinated.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Next up is Ellen Anderson.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm sorry, Erica Myers, followed by Reverend Robert Jeffrey.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Erica, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Good afternoon.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Can you hear me?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We can.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Go ahead.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Wonderful.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,My name is Erica.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I am a renter from District 1.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And I would like to urge the council to please support Council Member Sawant's resolution to join the 400 global organizations urging President Biden to waive the patent restrictions on the vaccine.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,This is not just a Seattle problem or the United States problem.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,This is a global issue that will take a collective to solve.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"It is wrong, I feel, to prevent anyone from having access to the vaccine.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,A few billionaires and big pharma can make record profits.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"It is the humane and just thing to do, so many lives can be saved.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I urge the council to support the resolution.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for your time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Thank you, Erica.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Next up is Reverend Robert Jeffrey.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And then I have Sreon A, who is appearing as not present on my side.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"So, Sreon, if you're listening, make sure that you are calling into the proper number, and also with the number that you registered with.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,All right.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Reverend Robert Jeffrey, please.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,My name is Robert Jeffrey.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm a pastor at New Hope Baptist Church, called to support Councilwoman Sawant's petition, a recommendation for patent waiver.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,There should be no price tag on human survival.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"At some point, we must understand that the welfare of the collective peoples of the world are more important than the individual concerns of the few who benefit financially from the collective.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We can only end this worldwide pandemic by moving beyond our preoccupation with privilege and legal constraints that continue to make individual corporate concerns more important or equal to the welfare of the common good of all humanity.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"People before profits are essential, especially in this time of a worldwide pandemic.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,All of our voices must unite in the call for medical justice.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you so much for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Again, one last time, Sreon is still showing up as not present on my sheet.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"So, Sreon, if you do call into the correct number with the number that you registered with, I will make sure to come back in calling you.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Next up is Ty Saxon followed by Jordan Quinn.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Go ahead, Ty.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,You have to hit star six so that we can hear you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Cool.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Sorry.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,My name is Ty Saxon.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm an economics teacher, and I rent an apartment in District 3.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm also calling to urge the City Council to support Council Member Sawant's resolution on COVID vaccines and intellectual property rights so we can end this artificial vaccine scarcity, which is creating a large and very dangerous gap in vaccination rates between high-income and low-income countries.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,This enormous gap is important not just because of the unfairness of the world's poor being left behind but because of the risk the situation poses to the whole world.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,The pandemic has allowed it to spread unchecked through the developing world.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"It's a certainty that we will see more mutations, and we really don't want to mess around and find out just how bad this thing can get.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"So we should do everything possible to get the whole world vaccinated as quickly as possible, which we clearly are not doing right now because the U.S. and other wealthy countries insist on maintaining these patents and intellectual property rights, which we know are not necessary for innovation because most of this research was funded by taxpayers.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,So we have to put people's lives over corporate profits during this unprecedented human crisis.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thanks.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Jordan Quinn, followed by Varshika.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Go ahead, Jordan.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Hi.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Can you all hear me?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We can.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Go ahead.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Great.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,My name is Jordan.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm a member of Socialist Alternative and a renter in District 2, calling in to urge the Council to pass Councilmember Sawant's resolution, calling on the Biden administration to grant vaccine IP waivers.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"The Trump admin led opposition to the WTO COVID-19 waiver when South Africa and India first proposed it in October 2020, and because WTO decisions are taken by consensus, the U.S. and very few other WTO members were able to block the waiver, even though the proposal has support from over 100 other countries.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And after three months of being in office, U.S. officials from the Biden administration have maintained that Trump position in the WTO.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"We can't have faith that capitalism will solve this crisis when its central motor, the drive for profit, stands in the way of global vaccination.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,It's going to take mass pressure from below to force Biden's hand and the WTO's.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"So in addition to a protest on April 30th, the City Council can act on this urgent issue by standing with the billions of workers in formerly colonized countries against profit-driven vaccine nationalism by passing this resolution.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for calling in.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Varshika, followed by Mary Ann Mercer.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Can you guys hear me?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Yes, we can hear you.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Go ahead.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"My name is Varshika, and I'm a member of the Coalition of Seattle Indian Americans.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I urge the Council to pass Council Member Sawant's resolution, urging President Biden's administration to support the waiver on the IP rights around COVID vaccines, share the relevant technology and the know-how publicly, lift the ban on export of vaccine supplies, and to do so with no delay.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"The WTO directors stated that almost 90 percent of the vaccines have gone to the rich countries, while the Global South has received just 0.2 percent.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"On an average, one in four people in the rich countries have received a COVID vaccine, compared with just one in more than 500 in the low-income countries.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"This is a humanitarian crisis at large, and we should remember that the virus does not differentiate the rich from the poor.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"The Council must show leadership, declaring to the U.S. government to put people before profit and pass the resolution today.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for the opportunity.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Mary Ann, followed by Matthew Wilder.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Yes, this is Mary Ann Mercer.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm emeritus faculty at the University of Washington, and I also want to speak on the patent waivers for the COVID-19 vaccines.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,But I just want to addition to all these important comments that you've already heard.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"The question is, why should the city council weigh in on this?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And to me, frankly, it's because you folks are national leaders in addressing important social and economic challenges, meaning minimum wage, homelessness, police violence.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Taking a stand on this issue as something that's fundamental for Seattle, as well as for the rest of the world, it'll send an important message for other city governments all around the country.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"You represent us all on this important issue, and we will, again, greatly appreciate a principled stand on, in this case, how we can equitably counter the pandemic everywhere.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Next up is Matthew, followed by Raghav Kaushik.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Hi, my name is Matt.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I'm a renter in Capitol Hill and a tech worker.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,I just want to urge the council members to vote yes on council member Salant's resolution urging Biden to waive intellectual property laws.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,The private ownership of intellectual property is a barrier to overcoming this global pandemic.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"The world population is one population, so inequality in production and distribution is a structural issue that undermines recovery internationally.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,The billionaire class wants it both ways.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"They want to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but also want to reap as many profits as possible from this profit-based distribution setup.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And so this kind of setup is like vaccinating only the richest parts of the cities while ignoring the working class neighborhoods, but on a much larger international scale.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And ultimately, we need international production of vaccines run democratically by health care workers in the interest of public health, not in billionaire profiteers who are putting us at risk right now.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And next up, we're going to hear from Raghav Kaushik.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Can you hear me?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,We can.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Go ahead.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,My name is Raghav.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I'm also here to urge everyone to support the resolution sponsored by Kshama Sawant, urging the Biden administration to suspend IP rights on COVID vaccines.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"I just want to point out that by now, this is a demand that is demanded by a majority of the world, actually.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"It's only blocked by a majority of countries in the WTO, which represent a majority of the population in the world.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,And it's only blocked by a minority of big pharma interests.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And unfortunately, also the Biden administration, which is siding with big pharma so far.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"And I also want to point out that in addition to all of these widespread support, you should be noticing from the public comments itself that there's a wide array of even citizens in this area who are supporting this demand, ranging from South Asians like organizations like API, Chaya, the Indian Association.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,Thank you so much for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,"Colleagues, that does bring us to about 34 minutes of I'm sorry, 32 minutes of public comments.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,So I had allotted 30 minutes for public comment.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,3ff69ec37fe6,So I am going to go ahead and conclude the public comment period.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I'm going to go ahead and call on the first two speakers for public comment today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Our first two speakers are Howard Gail followed by Cody Zaleski.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Howard, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Good afternoon.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Howard Gail, District 7, commenting on continuing failure to have police accountability in Seattle.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"This Friday in four days we commemorate the fourth anniversary of the SBD's brutal murder of Charlene Lyles who was pregnant, leaving her four children motherless.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"At a public meeting after this murder, Councilmember Juarez said, quote, we will demand accountability, transparency and community oversight and not allow this to happen.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Council President Gonzalez said, quote, I want you to hold us accountable.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"We can't wait any longer for these systems to be changed, unquote.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"And Councilmember Herbold said that, quote, we are already shamed.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,What I am pledging to you is to work on finding a new way of doing things so that we can actually get different results.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"I will use the power that I have on the city council to change what is happening today in our city, unquote.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"But then the following years brought us the brutal SBD killings of Ayocea Palo Togo, Danny Rodriguez, Ryan Smith, Shawnee Kerr, Terry Kaver and Derek Caden.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Not only had nothing changed, but the families and loved ones of those killed by the SBD had to suffer, in addition to a brutal and unjust loss, a complete failure of accountability and justice because their loved ones were killed in Seattle where truly independent investigations have been and remain impossible.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Seattle's police accountability system deemed all of these killings either lawful and proper or have not even completed or attempted an investigation into these killings.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"A recent NBC News report on officers who have repeatedly shot people focuses on one Seattle officer who shot four people, killing three, including the horrifying and completely avoidable murder of Ryan Smith in 2019.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"It is only through 100% civilian-led and run accountability that these past bad acts can be revealed, thereby preventing future ones.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I invite everyone here to join Seattleites in a city initiative to finally create full civilian oversight of police by going to seattlestop.org.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,That is seattlestop.org.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Thank you so much for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Our next speaker is Cody Zaleski, followed by Sage Wilson.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Cody, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Hi.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Oh, hi.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"My name is Cody Zaleski, and I'm a resident of District 4.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I'm here representing the organization Decriminalize Nature Seattle.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Our group seeks to have entheogenic plant medicine be listed as the lowest long-term priorities with protection to medical practitioners.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I'd first like to thank the seven Seattle City Council members for their signatures last week on a letter submitted by Council Members Lewis and Council Members Herbold.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,There is increasingly more recognition that the Schedule 1 designations of psychedelic entheogenic medicine is based in archaic misinformation.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,The examination and inclusion of these medicines in the OEIR Task Force is an extremely welcome change.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,We find that these entheogenic substances are incredibly valuable in the treatment of pathological rumination and psychiatric disorders.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Not only do these medicines carry low to no risk of addiction and abuse, but are actually beneficial in treating the abuse of their substances, such as alcohol and opiates.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Based on preliminary evidence, these medicines even exceed the success rate of 12-step programs.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"In addition to their inclusion on the OEIR Task Force, we would ask the City Council to signal their support by taking the very modest step of making enforcement of drug laws related to entheogens the lowest law enforcement priority as soon as possible.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"If the City of Seattle passes our measure, we would be the eighth city in the country to acknowledge the benefits of these substances and send a signal to state and federal lawmakers that people are ready for more comprehensive legal change.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Thank you, and I cede my time.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Thank you so much for calling in today, Cody.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Next up is Sage Wilson, followed by Raymond Evans.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Sage, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Hi, Sage Wilson here on behalf of Working Washington today to urge you to pass the Contractor Transparency Ordinance today, including the intention by Council to act this year to make the gig economy pay up.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,The COVID crisis has become a COVID bonanza for gig companies.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Instacart alone added more than a half million new workers this past year.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"The gig companies have established new lines of business from prescription delivery to restaurant staffing, and dozens of executives have struck it rich.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"In fact, DoorDash's CEO was paid $400 million last year, one of the very highest pay packages on record.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Meanwhile, the people doing the work are paid as little as $2 a job, and too many food delivery workers can't afford food themselves.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"City Council took bold and effective action last year to pass emergency hazard pay in six days for many gig workers, and these laws have made a tremendous difference.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"However, as we look to the possibility of these emergency laws expiring, it's time to take the next step and act to advance permanent policies that raise pay, protect flexibility, and provide meaningful transparency to all gig workers.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,The timeline for action in the ordinance before you today is an important step in that direction.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"And as we work with stakeholders to hammer out a policy that raises pay, protects flexibility, and provides transparency, we welcome the clear statements about Council's intention to end what is effectively a subminimum wage for people who rely on gig work, including people of color, immigrant workers, workers with disabilities, LGBTQ workers, and other marginalized workers.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I note also that Council is taking action today on a permanent policy to address some of the concerns raised by community restaurants about their dealings with gig companies.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"We appreciate Council has a multifaceted approach to reining in abuses by these multibillion-dollar corporations, and are glad to see Council is taking steps to address the needs of gig workers at the same time.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Thank you again for your work on the transparency ordinance before you today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"I look forward to it passing, including the language stating Council's intention to act this year to make the gig economy pay up.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Thanks for calling in, Sage.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Next up is Raymond Evans, followed by Kim Wolfe.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Raymond, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Thank you, Council members.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"My name is Raymond Evans, and I represent gig workers here in the Seattle-Puget Sound region.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I've worked at Nordstrom for 22 years as a personal stylist of a very high-end clientele that serves in multiple capacities.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I'm a local native of Seattle and also feel that the city has always been a place that I can relate to.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"But as a Black gay male who's gotten older and things have changed, the city is changing face, and I feel like we're leaving people behind and they're falling through the cracks.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,The gig work is a nice fallback.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"It allows people of color, Black, brown, whatever color they may be, to have a way to obtain a life for themselves, come to a city that's a wonderful place, provide a life, pursue a life, and make ends meet for themselves.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"But when we're doing work as gig workers and large companies that are making billions of dollars in profits are expecting us as the person who's already gone through trauma and trying to make a contribution to society to continue to rely on the graciousness of others who are also stressed, we fall through the cracks.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,People are making $3 and $4 an hour.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,We're riding around in cars that we can't pay permits on.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,We can't pay the licensing fees.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,We can't pay the maintenance.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"It's imperative that the city council, I encourage the city council to consider voting on this bill today for transparency so that we can have a better understanding of what these corporations are really doing so that Seattle can continue to be a city which is based in values, diversity, multiculturalism, ethnic sensitivity, Black Lives Matter.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"So I encourage you guys today to make that happen, and thank you for your time.",

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I'm Kimberly Wolfe.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"I'm a gig worker, and I'm supporting the passage of CB 1269, mostly because of the transparency that's in there, which is the first step that we need in order to know what exactly is happening and make sure that fair and just work is done.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Make sure that fair standards are there for everyone.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Also, the commitment in this bill to pass fair labor standards or pay standards this year is the thing that I'm most excited about, and I really hope that you guys get this passed today.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I concede the rest of my time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Thank you.,

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Erin, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Hi, I'm Erin Burkhalter.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"I am a project manager with the LEAD programs in the southwest area of King County, which includes the southwest precinct that opened operations in December.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I'm here to talk about funding LEAD to bridge a gap to meet the needs of our community.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"In the southwest precinct, we have a great relationship working with area organizations, residents, and business owners, the latter of which are particularly excited about LEAD arriving to west Seattle and ask me all the time, what can we do to help?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,And they are also asking in what ways we might be able to help them.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"With a $3 million funding gap, we are asking businesses and residents for their patience, even though we have an important group who can help us prevent people from landing in the criminal justice system.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Filling the gap will not only provide us with resources in terms of case management we need for the program to be successful, but it will allow our community as well to participate in a program that prevents harm to the clients that we serve and impacts to the surrounding area.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Thank you very much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Thank you for calling in, Erin.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Next up is Michelle Thomas, followed by Mariah Mitchell.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Michelle, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Hi, I'm Michelle Thomas with the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance, testifying with strong support for the transparency ordinance before you today, including the commitment to take action to enact a minimum compensation policy for gig workers this year.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"The city and state have taken important steps to expand tenant protections and address our affordable housing crisis, but we have to do more, including by raising pay for gig workers who are some of the lowest paid workers in our city.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"According to the latest out of reach report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition, workers need a job paying more than $40 an hour to afford a two-bedroom apartment in King County.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"We have tens of thousands of jobs via apps like Instacart and DoorDash pay as little as $2 a job, far less than minimum wage.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,This is directly related to housing justice and the current eviction crisis.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Economic security is housing security.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"When people get paid a living wage, they can afford to pay the rent.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,This is also about racial justice and creating an equitable recovery from the pandemic.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,BIPOC workers are highly represented as both gig workers and as renters.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,BIPOC renters disproportionately face housing insecurity and eviction.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Ensuring fair and decent wages for gig workers is critical for racial justice and housing stability.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I urge you to pass the transparency ordinance today with the commitment to take action this year to end the subminimum wage for gig workers.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Thank you so much for calling in, Michelle.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Next up is Mariah Mitchell, followed by Jason Reeves.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Go ahead, Mariah.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Mariah, I see that you are unmuted on my end, but we cannot hear you, so check to see if you're muted on your phone.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Okay, I am.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Can you hear me now?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Yeah, we can hear you.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Go ahead.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Okay.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"My name is Mariah Mitchell, and I am calling in for the transparency today.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"I would like to say that I am a family member of Charlena Lyles, and I also grew up by the North Precinct, and I am very familiar with the racism that comes out of that precinct.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"But the reason I am calling today is with Working Washington, and I'm calling on the transparency on CB120069.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"I'm a single mom of three, and this last year, I've had to make the hard choices of whether to stay at home to help my children with schoolwork or bring us an income.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,My eldest child would likely stay at home in order to help the family out so that I could work as an Uber Eats driver instead of being able to attend her own activities.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,And the companies I have worked for boast the ability to make a flexible schedule for ourselves yet penalize us when daily life happens.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Establishing labor standards for gig workers would ensure transparency, continued flexibility, access to stability, and overall enrichment of our lives.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,It would also set equity standards for all so that nobody is getting paid less than minimum wage.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"When I first started working, the pay was great.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I could do this.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"They cut our pay time and time again, currently without the hazard pay.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"The pay is substandard, and you can't live off of $2.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Along with that, they have done unfair background check and also have deactivated us without giving us a reason.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,You must create labor standards with full transparency for all gig workers.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I cede my time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Next up is Jason Reeves, followed by Daniel Aruz.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"And, Daniel, if you are listening, you are showing up as not present on my end, so I won't be able to call on you until you show up as present.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,So double-check those numbers that you're using to call in.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Otherwise, we're going to hear from Jason Reeves, followed by Tiara Dearborn.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Jason, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Thank you for having me.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,This actually marks my second year coming to the city council.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"And I, again, am also with Working Washington, and I've been coming here for two years asking for city council to back us up with minimum wage standards and transparency and help us truly keep making money out there.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Like Mariah said, we've seen pay cut after pay cut after pay cut while their revenues and all their stock prices and whatnot go up and up and up, and it's all because of us.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,We're out there making work happen.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"We need you guys to back us up because it's obviously, as we've seen with Prop 22, when they have the chance to make laws themselves, they make them themselves and they make it at the expense of the worker who is actually the best resource.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Satellites, we can do better.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I've been asking for the last two years.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Come on, let's get this right.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Let's do it now.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"I'm really, really excited.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I think we're on the right track.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"We've been able to get the minimum wage standards, the transparency, the step in the right direction, but we need to keep going.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,And a happy two year anniversary.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I see the rest of my time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Thank you, Jason.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Thanks for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Next up is Tiara Dearborn.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Again, William, if you're listening, make sure you double check those credentials that you called into the meeting for.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"And if you show up as present, I will give you your two minutes.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Tiara.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Hi, my name is Tiara Dearborn, and I'm a project manager for LEAD in Seattle.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,I'm here to provide thanks to the council for today's proposed amendment of Council Bill 120096 that will fill LEAD's 2021 budget deficit.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,This will mean that we can continue to provide desperately needed wraparound case management services for individuals most traditionally impacted by the criminal legal system.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,That will work to actually address the underlying needs contributing to this behavior.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"This means that we can continue employing our case management team, including BIPOC individuals and individuals with lived experience who have dedicated their careers to doing this incredibly difficult and rewarding work.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,We can continue responding to community members and stakeholders' requests for a response that is not traditional enforcement to address low-level public order concerns.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Thank you for calling in today, Tiara.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"Okay, I'm going to double check my spreadsheet here to see if any of the individuals who are pre-registered and showed up as not present are now present.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,And I am still seeing Daniel and William showing up as not present on my end.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,b6ea23f7a9a3,"So, IT, can you confirm that we don't have anyone else in the waiting room that is pre-registered and for public comment?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,Public comment is now open.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,It is 2.20 p.m.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,So we will go until 2.40 p.m. or until we run out of folks to call on.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,We'll begin with the first speaker on the list.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,Please remember to press star six after you hear the prompt of you have been unmuted.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,First up is Howard Gale followed by Joe Kunzler.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Howard, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Hi, good afternoon.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Howard Gale, District Seven, commenting on police abuse and failed accountability.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,There are currently a large number of bills on police reform and accountability before the state legislature.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"In particular, I'll note two.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Substitute House Bill 1267, the result of the governor's task force on investigating police use of force provides that, quote, investigators should not be commissioned law enforcement officers, unquote, nor have been one in the prior two years, and that if an investigator was ever a law enforcement officer, quote, the director must conduct a review of prior disciplinary actions or complaints related to bias, unquote.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Seattle's model is almost the complete opposite of that, requiring, requiring that SPD sergeants either exclusively investigate or serve as lead investigators on all serious misconduct cases.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Substitute House Bill 1203 makes mandatory local civilian oversight boards, which, in complete contradistinction to Seattle's model, provides for full investigatory subpoena power and discipline.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,The bill also prevents any person currently employed by law enforcement from serving on the community oversight board.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Despite the progressive advances in the state legislature, the current city council appears determined to keep us mired in failed pseudo-accountability measures by demanding the legislature exempt Seattle police reform efforts from state legislation.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,Let's be clear.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,The council is currently demanding that accountability and justice be delayed.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"It is way past time to advocate for a fully civilianized police accountability subsystem under true community control, not a community commission without any power that spends too much time listening to itself and to experts and far too little time listening or giving voice to the community.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Why does Seattle not deserve the police accountability system that the people of Newark, New Jersey, Nashville, Tennessee, San Diego, Portland, and Orlando have chosen, a system that the legislature is now considering?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,Next up is Joe Kunstler.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Good afternoon, Seattle.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"First, after watching the council president on a brand new cruise regarding police accountability, it's safe to say that the council president has undergone a realignment of the policy.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,The same council president who doesn't walk the talk and claims to watch it is much more conclusive.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"With that, at this hour, two bills are proceeding forward about the civil requirements of self-reliance to keep us mired in failed pseudo-accountability measures against the programs which can easily get passed, and easily get passed.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,The first is HB 1329.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,That's B-I-T dot L-I slash W-A H-B 1329.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"The bill that's within it will, among other things, allow a virtual option to publicly disclose in a way that would deny Alex Newman the platform to spew hate ever again.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"I ask Seattle City government to weigh in favor, please.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Reinforcing defenses for a more inclusive, more deliberative Republican democracy, as your wonderful council staff and president have done.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"The second is HB 1304, regarding expediting Seattle's bill, to fill up the Seattle City map, to expedite white rail to only serve immigrants.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"I ask the Seattle City Council, please help me help my Seattle city friends tomorrow.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Finally, I want to circle back to HB 1329 and regathering Stone, Rapets, Press, and Gonzales, crafts to get Seattle vaccinated like the logical lioness she truly is.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"In the event this bill, HB 1329, would be passed, or the remote options aren't exercised, Alex Newman will return.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,I understand Seattle is having an election for mayor and South Dakota board member.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Let me paraphrase what's the future, as you spoke about 1939, right before World War II would break out.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Quote, at this moment in its long history, it would be the best.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"And pathetic, it would be shameful if the Seattle City Council wrote itself off as an effective and important factor in the situation.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"That is why Anne-Marie and Gonzales are so worthy of endorsement for South Dakota board member and mayor, and I endorse.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,Thank you so much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Okay, our last speaker is speaker number five on my list.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"And that is, I'm sorry, hold on just a minute.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Eternally 12, Treehugger, Maya Carey, Reincarnated Butterfly, Al Bholme, Helmetless Cyclist, Polyamorous, Compassing Four Brother Husbands, Colonized Black Indigenous, Hammer.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Speaker number five, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Hi, Connie Begin speaking.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,We can hear you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Okay, good.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"I'm calling because, oh, I feel so nervous right now.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"I haven't given public comment for quite a moment, but since I called a few months ago in 2020, another city has gone on board, Mount Rainier and Maryland, they have become the fifth city to lower the voting age to 16.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"But when I called you into the public meeting a few months ago, I asked the council to consider lowering the voting age to 12 because the movement, the black power movement to end colonialism as usual has continued and us activists on the streets are tired of the rent crisis that we continue to face, the regular police terrorism that is instilled in our constitution and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Further, the state of Hawaii has introduced legislation to lower the voting age to 16 and so has the Congress.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"So Seattle, you're supposed to be one of the most liberal progressive cities in the nation and yet you guys are still behind those five Maryland cities, you're still behind the state of Hawaii.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"You guys literally have a socialist on the city council meeting because I guess I'm talking to you, darling.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Now, granted, I didn't vote for you because I didn't have my registration in a situation because I was a houseless person, I'm still houseless now.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"So, and the situation of houselessness is something that addresses all ages from womb to tomb.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,The situation of the pollution that plagues the air is something that addresses all ages from womb to tomb.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"So, and with that said, my second point was rank-swift voting.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Literally, I don't know which of y'all are up for re-election but even if you were not up for re-election, rank-swift voting empowers people to choose more than just one and polyamorous",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"And again, my other, my very point is that y'all need to recognize polyamorous relationships and we out here, is my time up?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"You got about five seconds, go ahead.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,"Well, yeah, y'all should recognize polyamorous relationships and that's my last point.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,Thank you so much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,e5c877619172,That is the last speaker we have signed up for public comments.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"At this time, I am going to open public comment with the first two speakers on the list.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"As a reminder, when you are done speaking, please do disconnect and continue following us at Seattle Channel or on the Listen In options posted on today's agenda.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"I hear you, Trevana Thompson- Wylie.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thanks for being with us.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,But any of you who are with us following Trevana will be Camille – Jim.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Hello.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Apologies.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"There is a fire alarm going off in my building, but my name is Trevana.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,I am a resident of District 2.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,I am calling in support of the Solidarity Budget and its Blueprint on food sovereignty to create a healthy community citywide.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,I am not afraid or ashamed to speak about my experience receiving food from food banks.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"She was priced out of her home in the Central District and she lives outside the city and money is tight, so she goes to the food bank quite often.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,The Solidarity Budget offers food support and food sovereignty by investing $17.7 million for the survival of our most vulnerable residents.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Food insecurity has been exacerbated by COVID-19 and the climate crisis that's making it harder and harder for BIPOC producers to grow food for local communities.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Our community has been suffering and struggling.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,The pandemic is far from over and the impact of receiving resources is hurting BIPOC folks.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,The UW just put out a blog post in July about how Washington residents continue to experience a drastically higher level of food insecurity from 10% before the COVID-19 pandemic to now 27%.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,How can we close that gap?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Well, we can do that by actually looking at the recommendations from the Solidarity Budget.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,The Mayor's budget does not have a dedicated section for food access or food sovereignty indicating perhaps this is not a priority for the city.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Food access is sprinkled throughout the budget a number of times, making it difficult to determine exactly how much is being budgeted specifically for food access.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"With just under 5% of the proposed STD budget, we could fund the entire food access program from the Solidarity Budget Plan.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Should we fund cops or feed people?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Should we fund more STD violence or house people?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Should we fund more new cops or provide childcare to working families?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Show your support, show that you care, and support the recommendations from Solidarity Budget, and I relinquish the rest of my time.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Thank you very much, and good morning, Camille.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Camille is followed by Tyler Harmon.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Hi, there.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,This is Camille Gix.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"I am with the advocacy team at Real Change, and I would like to address the agenda items on homelessness and food insecurity.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,I would like to address the agenda items on homelessness investment and housing and human services.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"So I'm calling in first of all to request that the Budget Committee considers allocating $80,000 toward the Seattle Street Sink Program.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,We want to continue expanding the Clean Hands Collective and fund some vendor maintenance jobs.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"We weren't able to do this with the first round of funding due to the cut that we experienced from $100,000 to $60,000 in the past year, and if we want to continue this essential program in 2022, we will need this funding in order to cover maintenance, staff time, and construction of new sinks.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"And we would also like to point out that the city's standards for our program have been very different from those of their own program, as outlined in Erica Barnett's article in Publicola published in February.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Additionally, we would like to call on the members of the Council to co-sponsor Councilmember Morales' budget amendments involving funds to allow tenants to purchase their building, permanent toilets downtown, and the acquisition of buildings for social housing.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Yesterday, I, along with some of my or with one of my colleagues on the advocacy team, spoke to several vendors about their priorities regarding the city budget, and we were met with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of vendors expressing a lot of importance for public toilets and also the increased social housing.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"And in the words of one of our vendors, who when asked what he thought the top priorities of the city should be in the 2022 budget, the only two words he said were permanent housing.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"And with that, I relinquish my time.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you so much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"And good morning, Tyler.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Tyler is followed by Mary Ellenstone.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Good morning, Tyler.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Good morning, Councilmembers.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Thank you so much for having me, and thank you so much for your time here on Council.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,My name is Tyler Harmon.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"I am a college student at the University of Washington, specifically with their College of Built Environments and their planning department.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"And for David Bloom's Studio 498 right now, we are conducting a feasibility study with the Elizabeth Gregory House into taking a look at what it would take to create a shelter within the U District.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"U District is a very underserved area, District 4 specifically for Council Peterson.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"There are no shelters within the area at the current moment, so we are taking a look at it.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"I just have a very simple question, actually.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,It seems through my team's findings that funding is available to try and conduct research within to what is causing the homeless crisis.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,There's also a lot of funding going towards facilities such as Harborview as well as medical center.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,When it comes to training staff facility and to how to not succumb to compassion fatigue when dealing with individuals experiencing homelessness.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"However, when it comes to actual money being allocated to housing, there just simply is not enough.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"The question that I have for Council, why is this such an unpopular issue?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"It seems very popular that we can fund research and we can fund acute clinics, yet when it comes to actual housing, there just is never funding for that.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Why is this such a politically unfavorable topic?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Housing.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,And Mary Ellen is followed by Susan Samuelson.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Hey, Mary Ellen.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,I see you on the screen.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,If you can hit star six one more time to unmute.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Hi there.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,That works?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,That works.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Hi there.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thanks for taking my test.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thanks for taking my testimony.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"I'm from King County Sexual Assault Resource Center and speaking today on behalf of the Coalition Ending Gender-Based Violence, asking the Council to support our request of $3 million to fund what we know already works, which is survivor-driven mobile advocacy with flexible financial assistance.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,The Mayor's budget doesn't allocate any new funding for expanding these services.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,I would ask you to consider that today in your budget package.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"We know, and I know you know, domestic violence and sexual assault are some of the top precursors to homelessness, housing instability, mental health issues and substance abuse.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,We see this every day.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Now is not the time to underinvest in these services.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"I will say from KSARC, we are seeing a significant increase in the need for these services.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,We saw an increase in need for like 20% over last year and the year before.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,So the demand is considerable and the demands on our organizations to be able to meet these needs is very high as well.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,So asking you to support this additional request and we'll be happy to answer more questions at a later time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you so much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,My name is Susan Samuelson and I'm here to speak on the issue of early learning funding.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,I live just north of the University District and I'm current chair of the Board of University Heights.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"I want to thank you for your commitment to increasing early learning opportunities, especially for families who are lower income.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"As you know, the lack of early learning opportunities has been an issue even before the pandemic.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Since the pandemic, there's been a 30% reduction in King County early learning slots.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"I understand also that nearly one in five parents have turned down a job offer or a promotion due to child care issues, especially among BIPOC communities.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Nearly half of unemployed parents cite child care issue as a barrier to their employment.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"University Temple Children's School, an early learning program in the U District for 50 years, lost its home when the University Temple Church was demolished.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"The U Heights Board has been so gratified to be able to welcome the school to its historic school building, but we need to make several capital upgrades to obtain our DCYF child care license and thereby save 70 early learning slots.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,50% of those places will be allocated to low-income families who otherwise could not afford child care.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Please consider the cost of these capital upgrade needs in the city's budget.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you very much.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,I'm BJ.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,BJ will be followed by Janine Falls.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"Good morning, BJ.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,"This year's budget includes additional funding for solidarity budgets, housing and food access recommendations, along with the people's budgets recommendations to fund additional tiny house villages and RV safe slots with wraparound services and to place provisos on these funds to ensure they get spent on these programs.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,This year has shown how important protecting funding is.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,In October we finally had our budget.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Building housing and safe shelters like tiny house villages so my unsheltered neighbors can come in from outside is somewhat personal.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,It means Grandma C not freezing to death in her tent this winter.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,It means Paige has somewhere to go to get away from the next round of wildfire smoke which causes issues with her asthma.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,It means Bill not being assaulted by sheltered community members yet again because they don't like seeing their belongings in the trash while they're at work yet again.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,It means Patrick doesn't have to spend half of his morning trying to find a bathroom that's open to him because large portions of Seattle really are public bathroom deserts.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,So I really urge you to support those items.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you and I yield my time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,Thank you for calling this morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,f45c27e8169e,And the next two speakers are going to talk about the public comment session.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,8070e17c504d,"And at this time, we will open the remote public comment period.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,8070e17c504d,"And again, it remains the strong intent of the Seattle City Council to have public comment regularly included on meeting agendas.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,8070e17c504d,"However, we do reserve the right to end or eliminate this public comment period at any point.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,The public comment period is now open and we will begin with the first speaker on the list.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"For general public comment, I see Holly Towns, Steve Zempke, Suzanne Grant, and David Haynes.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,I see Deb Barker for item number 4 and Richard Ellison also for item number 4.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Richard Ellison, I'm seeing that you want to talk about the tree protection ordinance.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Do you also?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,So we'll probably call on you just to see what's going on there.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"First three folks up, Holly Towns, Steve Zempke, Suzanne Grant.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Holly, good morning.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,I see you there.,

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Steve Zempke, you're up.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Press star 6 and Holly Towns will come back to you at the end.,

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Steve, hang on just a second.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Holly, good morning.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Take it away.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Holly, you're off mute now, but you might be on mute on your phone.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,There we go.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"One more time, Holly.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,All right.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Let's move on to Steve Zempke.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Holly, if you come off mute, just hang tight until Steve's done and then we'll take you up.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Steve Zempke, please, star 6.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Having trouble with Holly and Steve.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Maybe promote Suzanne Grant and let's just.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Suzanne Grant, good morning, star 6.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Hello, this is Suzanne.",

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,I'm addressing agenda number 6.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"SDCI, we are wondering why we do not have an ordinance to save our trees.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Your words get old as the trees are sold.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,You're making lots of money off developer fees.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,The permits keep on selling.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,They keep cutting our trees.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Have you no conscience?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,How can you sleep at night?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,You never look into the future through your children's eyes.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Fires burning hotter.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Cities without trees.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,The climate is changing in our lifetime while you're telling lies.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Knowing the trees you're cutting down could be saving lives.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Stop the stall.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,End the exemptions.,

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Yeah.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Good morning.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,21st century first world quality housing is what younger generations need.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Originally built classic homes of first world quality, robust brilliance are justified to remodel and preserve the house built at 801 16th Avenue on a corner lot with much more traffic since 1909 originally meant for a single family has been patchwork fixed in 1937 as a duplex for the Catholic Church.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,God knows what they did in there.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"And again, in 1941 and 1951, all with add ons that had nothing to do with neoclassical quality, only perceptions of wealth then remodeled in 1984.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,This house violates the integrity and shouldn't be preserved.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,The building code violations only touch the surface of how flawed the design is to truly be considered a neoclassical mansion.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,It's offensive to the taste and reminder of Seattle's notorious embellishments and iconic misinterpretation of first world quality.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Only thing you're doing is a favor for a big bank donor, associated speculator and meddling for historical preservation dollars and looking for federal tax haven for owner at expense of future residents about to be shaken down with low quality living due to freaky clapboard housing chopped up into four living areas from one.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Seattle only preserves slums as favor to big bank owners and donors of Democrats still cheating the people out of any and all 21st century housing choices.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,It's another rental and dilapidated inflated obsolete flawed design causing mental crisis justifying a teardown redevelopment built as one.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Perhaps city council should sue to have zero taken off the property value since artificially inflated is abusing housing market.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"The house sold in 1988 for $194,000.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Now Democrats want to help a speculator secure a value of $2.4 million artificially suggested price for middlemen oppressing housing market.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Taking zero off property values would be more reasonable to preserve a $240,000 especially when they are lying about it being a neoclassical mansion versus two cheap wooden clapboard pillars to give it a tray chic two bit Seattle stamp of approval.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Proving how dishonest Democrats hate help.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Thank you.,

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,And if you have a headset in that might be why we couldn't hear you before.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Holly?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,All right.,

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,This is Steve Zempki speaking for tree pack.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Hang on real quick.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Thanks for resetting the timer.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Holly, hang tight just a second.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,We're going to let Steve speak for two minutes and then you're going to go.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,So okay.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,I can hear you now.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Yeah.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,I'll be quiet.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Thanks.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Good morning, Steve.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,We've reset your timer and please feel free to take it away.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Hey, good morning.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,This is Steve Zempki.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,I'm chair of tree pack.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,And I want to say that we as an organization are disappointed in the effort so far to update the current tree protection ordinance.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,No draft language has been available for public review.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,And we question how you can do a determination of non-significance without allowing the public to first review a draft and look at the impacts.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"We urge that the draft be available for not two weeks as usual, but eight months, because this is a very complex issue.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,We also have concern that we feel that very little outreach was done by SDCI and OSC and reaching people.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"For instance, they held listening sessions with 29 people and tried to draw conclusions on some major issues like whether or not there should be permits to remove significant trees.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Meanwhile, the tree pack along with the Northwest Progressive Institute has sent you previously a poll that we did that showed that we did with 617 people with a 4.3% margin of error and a confidence interval of 95% that said that creating a permitting process for removal of significant trees had a two to one margin, 57% supporting 28% opposing with 15% not sure.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Also increasing protection for significant exceptional trees pulled 78% to 13% in opposition and adding replacement requirements for significant exceptional trees pulled 76% to 13%.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,We think the poll shows the public support out there for this effort and that you need to listen to it.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"We also want to note that several years ago, two years ago, I guess two and a half years ago, we also did a change.org outreach which had 5,271 people saying you need to act.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,So please listen to the public and create a strong ordinance.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,That's not happening now.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Thank you, Steve.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Always appreciate hearing from you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"Holly, good morning.",

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Thank you for your patience.,

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,And I'm calling as you know to support the energy code amendment.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,But I'm really calling today to speak to you about the need to move ahead more aggressively on addressing climate change in existing buildings which contribute far more greenhouse gases than new buildings.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,I urge you to start working behind the scenes on how to address the existing buildings.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,There's lots of excellent resources and support in our city and people willing to help.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,There are other cities who are stepping forward now and now it's time for Seattle.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"You know, as an engineer, this crisis reminds me of a crack in the bridge, for example, in Magnolia.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,It is small now and seems insignificant perhaps.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,"But if we don't address it quickly, it will propagate and propagate faster, increasing in speed and resulting in the collapse of the bridge and a huge disaster both economically and health wise and for the lives of people.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,This is how the climate is now.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,And I know and I appreciate how hard you're working on have and are working on all the challenges in our city and there are many.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,But I ask you to take the climate crisis much more to heart and start working harder on this issue.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,4a7b19619e67,Thank you so much for your time.,

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,204e56db5489,Let me actually check with the clerk.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,204e56db5489,Do we need to run through the script if no one is signed up for public comment?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,204e56db5489,"» council member Strauss, if you would like to confirm with I.T. that there are no public commenters, you may proceed to the next business item.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,204e56db5489,» thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,204e56db5489,» there are currently no public comment registrants.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Public comment period is now open, and we'll begin with the first speaker on the list.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Again, please remember to press star six after you hear the prompt if you have been unmuted.",

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"This afternoon, the council will be voting on hiring incentives for police.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,I'm confused.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Isn't Seattle's lack of accountability for police those who beat protesters and kill people with immunity, isn't that enough incentive?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Our accountability system has judged nearly 90% of last year's police abuse cases against demonstrators to be without merit, and the highest punishment meted out has been simply a reprimand, and has found every SBB killing investigated so far to be, quote, lawful and proper, unquote.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Why do we have to add to their pay to entice them to do what some police already clearly enjoy?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,The council will pass a budget that provides well over $10 million to cover up police abuse while refusing to even consider shifting that money towards providing real police accountability.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Now, in a clear message to cops, you plan to offer them more money to work here without having to fear accountability.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Has it really only taken 18 months for you to abandon what you pretended to have learned post-George Floyd?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"If the council had the courage to admit the failings of our police accountability system, they could redirect these tens of millions of dollars towards real community oversight of police.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"We must invest these monies in a system that provides full civilian community control over police policy, misconduct investigations and discipline, as so many cities have done post-George Floyd.",

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"On behalf of our membership, we just wanted to share appreciation for Council Member Herbold and her leadership on Amendment HSD-019B, which adds $1.5 million for community-based survivor-driven advocacy services for survivors of gender-based violence in our city.",

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Much appreciation to Council Members Morales, Peterson, Gonzalez, Savant, and Strauss for your co-sponsorship of this critical support to survivors.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Thank you for seeing the need and showing your support during this tough budget year.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"I'm excited to see how so many of our programs serving survivors, culture-specific programs and so many use this support and funding to hire more staff or to offer flexible financial assistance to survivors who need it the most.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"We also wanted to thank Council Member Herbold, Council Member Morales, and Council Member Lewis for their support of OCR-002, which supports a DV stakeholder work group to explore alternatives to incarceration for those accused of misdemeanor domestic violence.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,This is an important first step to building alternatives to the criminal legal system.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Thank you so much again for all of your work and your time and dedication to gender-based violence and also for the time to speak to you today.,

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Good afternoon.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,David Haynes.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,I live in District 7.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,I haven't had a proper night's sleep in the seven months that I've lived down here because there's an uncivil war being conducted on the community and nothing's being done about the crimes that are trying to break in and take over my building.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"And excuse me for saying this, but City Council should reject this racist, treasonous, unconstitutional budget abuse of tax dollars redirecting public safety crisis and homeless crisis money to buy off George Floyd protesters accessing over $70 million while Council co-ops, redirects, and I dare say steals federal emergency COVID funds called Clipper Funds, money meant to solve the homeless crisis for people who can't find non-congregate COVID-concerned shelter, now instead redirected money to jumpstart taxes, manipulated with a spending plan providing middle-class gifts to non-citizens, foreign-born, certain skin color, monthly payments, while innocent poor citizens, not a criminal, are purposely not provided 21st century first world quality shelter.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Because City Council instructs Office of Housing and Human Services Department to redirect as much money away from solving the homeless crisis after raising money in the name of the homeless crisis for certain privileged house groups of voting blocs and nonprofit donors and unions who help with elections.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"It's unconstitutional to abuse and use federal relief money stolen from the homeless to fill in the general revenue shortfalls created by City Council, gouging, redirecting taxes to pay off protesters hiding within Solidarity Budget, Equitable Development Initiative, and Community Safety and Community Capacity Building nonprofits, creating fraudulent community safety.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"This budget is proof that Democrats used the taxpayers and the homeless crisis to get money that's redirected to buy re-election apparatus of activists, organizers, Democratic operatives hiding within all new 17 nonprofits pocketing millions of dollars to not protest.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Okay, next is Madeline Olson, followed by Silvia Gonzalez, and then Sean Burns.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Madeline, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Hi there.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Can you hear me okay?,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,We can.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Go ahead.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,All right.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Thanks.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Yeah.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,My name's Madeline.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,I'm just calling in about the budget.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"I'm just calling to say that I'm really excited to see the gains, like full funding for Right to Council, funds going to the Clean Greens to provide much-needed fresh produce to the Central District alongside our funding for the New Hope Housing Family Housing Project.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Excuse me.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Too many words.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"But yeah, I just want to say this is thanks to the movement-building approach of the Council members to want and the people's budget.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Because of this, we've been able to celebrate these victories.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Really excited to see this progress.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"But you know, overall, really want to say it's really disappointing to see that this budget does fail to meet the needs of working people and our communities.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"As the pandemic continues, you know, it's not over.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"We are seeing the world's billionaires make trillions of dollars, trillions with a T, you know, in profits while regular people are, you know, being buried under increasing amounts of debt, myself included.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"You know, renters are the majority of folks in Seattle, but rents are on track to increase over 40% this year alone.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,This is clearly an unsustainable situation.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Something has to break.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"But is it going to be regular working people, or are we going to go ahead and tax big business and billionaires to pay for the pandemic?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Similarly, we're seeing a continuation of a bloated police budget when we could take, you know, those funds, invest them into our working-class communities, especially black and brown communities, to address the actual root causes of our systemic racism and the violence that we see in Seattle.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"You know, this whole situation really could have been avoided, Council members to want, the people's budget and the solidarity budget, you know, they've all called for the massive increase of funding towards our affordable housing, the tune of $635 million in 2022, as well as an $85 million annually for a Green New Deal.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"You know, with a modest increase of the Amazon tax, we easily could have paid for these services, you know, the ones that we would need to address the housing environmental crisis that we're facing.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Thank you so much, Council members to want, for championing working people's needs.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,I'll leave it there for the time.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Thank you for calling in today.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Next up is Silvia Gonzalez, followed by Enshawn Burns, and then Colleen McKeelyer.",

cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Hola, buenas tardes.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Voy a dar mi testimonio en español.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Buenas tardes, miembros del Consejo.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Mi nombre es Silvia Gonzalez, trabajadora del hogar, organizadora de campañas para Casa Latina, y copresidenta del Standard Board de las Trabajadoras del Hogar.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Estoy aquí hoy para agradecer a todos los concejales, en especial a nuestra campeona Teresa Mosqueda, por el apoyo a la resolución para dar paso a una legislación de tiempo libre pagado portátil.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Un paso enorme y digno para esta industria, y a la vez un ejemplo para otras ciudades en toda la nación.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"También agradezco a los concejales por mantener intactos los $500,000 para aplicar las recomendaciones del Standard Board, los cuales incluyen la creación de una plataforma portátil de tiempo libre pagado y de días de enfermedad pagados.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Mi deseo es poder seguir contando con el apoyo de ustedes para la legislación de los beneficios portátiles en el 2022.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Gracias por su compromiso con este sector laboral.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Si se pudo.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Gracias Silvia por llamar.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Just really quickly, colleagues, I'm going to just roughly translate what Silvia Gonzalez said.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,She is calling in today to talk about the domestic worker portable benefits investments.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,The co-chair of the Domestic Worker Board and also an organizer at Casa Latina.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"She wants to thank all of the council members for the commitment to domestic worker issues, but especially wants to acknowledge the work of their champion Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda for putting forth a resolution for establishing portable benefits for domestic workers.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,She wants to thank the full council for the investments in the Domestic Worker Board recommendations.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Wants to continue to be able to count on City Council members for our support of the efforts in that space and wants to thank us for the future work that she knows we will do and appreciates everything that we have been able to do thus far.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Thanks folks.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Next is and Sean Burns followed by Colleen McAleer and then Daniel Ramona.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Hi all.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,My name is Sean Burns.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,At first I want to agree with the previous commenter.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"I'm also pretty excited about the gains that have been fought for and made it into the proposed budget this year and particularly that full funding for the right to counsel for tenants facing eviction, the funding for a fresh produce program in the central district, additional funding for tiny house villages and a safe parking lot for folks living in their cars.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Those are all real gains that working people I feel can be proud of and it's the result of fighting over the years through the people's budget movement as well as the renters' rights movement that emerged this year.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"But despite all that, I still feel that this budget is woefully inadequate to meet the needs of regular people in Seattle at this moment.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Like rents are still skyrocketing.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"A recent Census Bureau report found that 60,000 Seattle area renters are in debt to their landlords and this is a totally unsustainable situation, forcing people into Kent, into Renton.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,And this budget could and should have served as the response to increased taxes on the billionaires who have profited off of the pandemic and put funding into real solutions for the housing crisis in response to workers' demands.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Like the solidarity budget and the people's budget, they called for those increases in funding for affordable housing, which could have been done through an increase in the Amazon tax.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"It's a big numerary increase, but based on the profits that we've seen, like taxing big business for housing and Green New Deal programs is something that has enormous support in Seattle.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,And the record profits we've seen this year should not exist at the same time as the housing crisis that's at its worst point in years.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Like the status quo budget that's been put forward is disappointing given the historic economic and political developments over the last year.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,I definitely support council members who want to vote no on this budget.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"It's just not something that really meets the moment right now and I feel like council members should be more receptive to the pressure that we've been putting on them throughout the last couple of years in every perennial council member or excuse me, people's budget movement.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Thank you.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Thanks for calling in.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"I accidentally called on Colleen, but Colleen is calling in for the Seattle Park District meeting, so she will be on deck for Council Member Juarez to call on her for her comments.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"So we will hear from the last individual I have signed up for the city council meeting, and that is Daniel Kavanaugh.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"I do have William Smith signed up for public comment, but William is showing up.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,He's not present.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"So, Daniel, welcome.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"Hey, can you hear me?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Yes.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Okay.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,My name is Dan.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,I'm a renter in District 3 in First Hill.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,I'm an activist with the People's Budget Movement and I've been active in the Black Lives Matter protests and the Tax Amazon movement last year.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"And yeah, I, you know, the People's Budget Movement over the years, we've won countless victories.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"We've won millions in funding for, you know, housing and services with our movement-based fighting approach.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,This is the eighth consecutive year.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"You know, the People's Budget was first launched by Council Member Sawant, Socialist Council, alongside, you know, many affordable housing and homeless service advocates.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"We've won things like millions of dollars in affordable housing, services, justice, renter organizing, you know, funding for renter organizing and attorney services against evictions.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"And this year is no different, right?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"We've won victories this year in the budget, like additional funding for renter organizing.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Thank you to the Tenants Union of BC Seattle.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"We've won full funding for the Right to Council, which our movement won the right to earlier this year.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"It was one of the first of several victories of our renters' rights movement won this year, including six-month notice for rent increases, just cause protections for renters at the end of a fixed-term lease, relocation assistance, you know, ban on school-year evictions.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"And so, you know, our movement should feel really proud of what we've won, but, you know, this still is a business-as-usual budget on the whole that doesn't meet working people's needs and ultimately is totally inadequate, right?",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"And, you know, others have spoken to how, you know, billionaires have gotten trillions, trillions of dollars richer in the past year, and working-class people are struggling more than ever, right, are in debt to their landlords, you know, are, you know, falling behind on rent.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"In this context, you know, a business-as-usual budget is unacceptable.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,I really want to thank Council Member Sawant and the People's Budget Movement for providing for the maximum possible funds for working-class people out of this budget while also voting no on this business-as-usual budget.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,Okay.,
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,"The last person, again, that I have signed up but not present is William Smith checking in with our IT folks to make sure no one else is waiting in the waiting room.",
cdp-seattle-21723dcf,20dc9c63e26e,There are no more public comment registrants.,
