    "\n",
    "* one of the most common tasks in working with text is in classifying texts\n",
    "* this can include things like classifying the topic of the text, the sentiment (is the text positive or negative), is the text toxic, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the general idea is that it's useful to categorize text. Instead of having a big blob of text, here is it's classification for which scientists, users, etc. can filter, subset, search, and utilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "* for our use case, there are a couple of text classification models that we might be interested in\n",
    "    * sentiment classification models are pretty universally useful -- in our case, potentially using them when paired with public comments to see how many comments are positive or negative in tone\n",
    "    * identifying portions of the meeting by type -- i.e. \"this general section of text is public comment, this general section is discussion on a bill\", \"a presentation\", \"voting\", etc.\n",
    "    * topic classification models specific to legislative topics -- i.e. general topic models might have too broad of a topic for our use cases, we might want to be able to classify discussion to finer grain discussion points\n",
    "\n",
    "* this lecture will go over how to train a text classification model as applied to the \"topic classification\" task."
