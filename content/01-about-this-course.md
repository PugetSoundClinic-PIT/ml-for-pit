# About This Course

Welcome to Machine Learning for Public Interest Technology.

## Intro

### In this course you will...

* learn about public interest technology
* explore methods for analyzing large text based datasets
* apply pre-existing machine learning models
* practice implementing supervised machine learning models for text classification and span categorization
* combine techniques to analyze a dataset of city council meetings

### You will need...

* experience with Python and common scientific Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`.
* basic understanding of vectors and linear algebra
* a google (gmail) account for access to Colab

Thats it

4. Using State-of-the-Art Semantic Embeddings
5. Creating Text Classifiers
6. Applying Pre-trained Models
7. Combining It All To Analyze Discussion Activity

## Getting Setup

This course is taught using Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab.

Each chapter will have three parts:

1. A "lecture" / "reading" portion where I will first go through and explain the concepts and the code for the task at hand.

2. At the end of each lecture, I will link to an exercise that you should open in colab and try for yourself.

3. Finally, at the end of each exercise, I will include a link to reference code for how I have completed the exersises.

While the exercises should be completed interactively, all course content is reproducible. If you ever want to play around with the lecture example code or the reference code, you should feel free to do so by clicking the Launch in Colab button.

#### TODO

* create test colab notebook that has basic commands
